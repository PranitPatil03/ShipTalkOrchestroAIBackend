My boss hated my email system (inbox zero) with folders for everything based on the segment (Shipper, Carrier, origin agent, destination agent, trucker, etc) I did this with 125 shipments a week, FCL, LCL and Air. Having it all organized made things so much easier. Combining that with Quick steps and reminders saved me sooo many headaches. \n\nUltimately you need to teach your people (origin, shipper, destination agent, trucker, etc) how you want/expect things. Once you get that done it runs smooth, things happen but as long as you plan and prepare you should be fine. If you don't do anything, that's when the stress happens. \n\nAutomate as much as you can and look at the process constantly to see how you can simplify it. \n\nI use Chat GPT and other AI programs hourly to make adjustments. \n\nCarriers will respond to you if you threaten to take the work if they aren't doing it to the level you need. Short pay for incorrect ppwk and be on the lookout for new carriers.",

                "content": "Two main points from much experience here:\n1. Stress is often the bi-product of poor time management. Not always but often. If you designate 30 min time periods throughout the day for different task, you will find that you can dip into the most major parts of your AOR each day. You have to stick with it. If something urgent comes up and requires your immediate attention (always, I  know) then do it and return to your task window of time. \n\n2. Those of us that are diligent tend to take things personally when they don\u2019t go as planned. If there are things not under your direct control, let that shit go. I took all failures of other people and it ate me up. I\u2019m speaking mainly of internal operations like sales or finance. If it\u2019s a vendor making your life miserable, replace them. If it employees that report to you, replace them. But let what you can\u2019t fully control go.",

You know what will take 10 minutes and what will take 2 hours, not the person on the other end of the phone/email.\n\n\nPersonally, I start the day and bang out the quick tasks first. Then move onto the more detailed requests, and towards the end of the day start on the newest requests. \n\n\nI do get pulled away from this plan throughout the day to handle truly urgent and time sensitive items and that's ok. Handle that and then get back to the plan you made at the start of the day. \n\n\nAs other commentors have said, this is all about time management in the end and having an understanding of your abilities and your company and customers needs overall will help you navigate each day. There is always tomorrow and there is always more.",

We don't know what our volume will be. And I am going to assume we'd have 3-5 people working (mostly family and friends to start lol).\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions or input?",

Starting out, I'd recommend using ShipStation or similar solutions over Excel as your basic foundation.\n\nIn our early days, we used SkuLabs until we outgrew it. We then switched to SHero, which we've been using for the past 6 years. While SHero is comprehensive, it isn't cheap, so I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone just starting a 3PL.\n\nCurrently, we're exploring alternatives to SHero for various reasons (happy to discuss privately). Some options we've looked into include:\n\n* Warehance: A really solid and more affordable solution started by my friend who also used to use SHero\n* Packiyo: Created by an ex-SHero founder, seems fairly solid but lacked some features we needed\n* Logiwa: Another established option in the space\n\nWe've been moving over to Warehance and it's been working out really well for us. In this industry, you'll likely end up using one of the major players like SHero, Logiwa, or similar solutions as you grow.",

I really like Hopstack for the FBA part simply because the depth I have seen them go into with their Amazon flows. Dealing with Amazon is really tricky as everyone knows, and I have gone through switching many softwares before settling on Hopstack. Most importantly the customer service is awesome which is what you want from your WMS provider:\n\nHowever, I see that a lot of new merchants are also getting into starting prep businesses or starter 3PL businesses like yourself. Hopstacks main platform is prolly an overkill. So they have another product that was launched a while ago called Ignite that focusses on starter businesses. I\u2019ll highly recommend that. The alternatives that I have tried like scanpower, prepshiphub haven\u2019t been that great for my clients.\n\nYou can also stitch something together with excel and airtable, but the effort involved might not be worth your time. So I suggest keeping 200-300$ as a monthly budget for the software.",

        "content": "I've been at my current job for seven years and been in the logistics role since 2020. All of my training was done in a month and all additional \"training\" has been done by myself finding free seminars and such. The company I work for has been doing worse and worse due to declining sales and issues getting materials. Plus, they refuse to pay for an ongoing training.\n\nSo, I'd like to start looking and training for a new job. Would prefer remote but willing to move to a blue state for a job (currently live in a deep red one). I'm making $51,000 in my current role.\n\nMy duties include:\n\n* Importing containers of finished goods from Central America (filling out ISFs for broker, coordinating with warehouse and 3PL for delivery)\n* Exporting containers of materials to Central America (making bookings, creating MBOLs and Commercial Invoices, filing the EEIs on the Automated Export System (AES), providing all paperwork to the 3PLs we use)\n* Coordinating with freight companies to get our air shipments picked up quickly and delivered on time to customers\n* Ensure we are following all rules/regulations for C-TPAT compliance\n\nI've saved my company thousands of dollars by changing what companies we use and how we move our goods/materials. I've made actual SOPs instead of the handful of handwritten scribbles I was given by the person who trained me. Convinced our company to get our shippers HAZMAT certified because the one person in our company who was HAZMAT certified had quit.\n\nSo, I've got some experience but I'm not sure what roles I should look for or work on training for. I doubt I'd be good at sales (have never been in a sales position). Since I've only been at one company with little training (outside of what free seminars I've found online), I don't really know what my chances are against people with degrees or multiple roles. I'm not looking to make bank, just be comfortable.",

        "content": "I am currently in an operations role in an asset based 3PL company. My day to day is essentially as a dispatcher for our drivers and am basically a one man show for our freight brokerage operations. Truthfully, I am burnt out of operations and the complete and utter chaos that comes with both being asset based and running a brokerage. Im not really supported at my current company in that they wont hire anyone to help as we expand and frankly ownership runs things like it is the 1980s. It is like pulling teeth to modernize. Admittedly, freight is not our bread and butter as we are a distributor who delivers our own product more than we are a trucking company and the trucking and brokerage side exist just to support our distribution operations, so i am a bit of an afterthought and am expected to just move everything on a whim when we need more trucks for our outbound. Its an interesting idea to employ enough drivers and still have flexibility when outbound is slow. Im not upset at it, its what I was brought here to do but truthfully I am just burnt out from putting out fires with customers and managing drivers. I think I could have success in TMS software sales or support, where I can still use my knowledge of transportation and not be involved in the day to day of shipments, but thats just a thought. \n\nAnyone successfully transition out of operations and into a logistics adjacent role? If so, what are you doing now and are you doing well financially? ",

        "content": "Hi r/Logistics\n\nI consult for an organization that is looking for a US customs broker that can handle T86 entries for ecommerce for goods that cross the northern border by truck. Entry volume per day is around 5,000, increasing at peak. They ship six days a week, year round. Only a portion of these daily entries are on the table for this opportunity, but it is a permanent opportunity, and the percentage of entries to be filed as T86 will probably increase as regulatory ramps up in the US.\n\nThey're an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base. The client themselves holds all required FDA, Health Canada and other licenses or registrations. *This is not a marketplace like TEMU etc.* The clients have a mix of non-regulated and regulated products. Food, Dietary Supplements, general consumer household goods etc. COO is mixed but mostly COO US, Canada or China. These are currently cleared with a mix of S321, T86, informal and formal entries depending on the situation. They're looking for aggressive pricing from a broker well experienced in ecommerce that can handle mass submissions of entries (Excel template upload or API/EDI).\n\nThey're very savvy on compliance and IT fronts. The commodities don't change frequently - these are well known brands and products with long product lifecycles - again, this is *not* a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product day in, day out, each to a new consignee.\n\nDesired launch date is ASAP - they could start sending entries as soon as next week if the right partner is found.\n\nThey are looking to speak only with brokers who are well experienced with ecommerce T86. The daily trucking could be on the table in the future as well depending on the partner. This is potentially a multi-million dollar per year account for a brokerage / forwarder with the right service and product lineup. DM me for more detail and if you think you have a solution.",

The idea being that I can provide a standard address, receive their package from UPS/FedEx/etc, then forward the package through the desired delivery service as I would integrate with these other delivery services. \n\nIs this something that is feasible to do? Are there 3PL providers that can intake a single package and ship it out (ideally with no warehousing) for a reasonable fee?  \n  \nI don't know much about 3PL or logistics, so I'm fairly out of my depth on the logistics side of this idea.

However, I have worked with several companies that do this for international shipments where the end customers don't have a means of shipping into themselves since they're not in the US.  What type of shipments/products are you envisioning?",
