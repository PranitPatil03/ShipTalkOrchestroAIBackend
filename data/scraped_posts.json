Air freight will be your easiest option but you will need to check aircraft size before packing your pallets as there maybe size and weight restrictions. \n\nYou could try Vanguard or AGS for LCL options as they may have road onforwarding services through Mali. \n\nOr work backwards and use someone like AGL Niger. They have an agent network and can arrange all the way through and will sort customs clearance for you. \nhttps://www.aglgroup.com/en/transport-logistics-africa/niger/\n\nYour documentation will need to be correct for the import. This is where most people have issues when shipping into West Africa. Also make sure you understand duty and taxes % so you don\u2019t get caught out. Request a DDP rate. (Delivered Duties Paid)\n\nGood luck",

Based on the language in IATA, it sounds like I can use one label/mark to mark a package as containing UN3091 and UN3481 without special shipping requirements outside the normal packing instructions. Am I correct? I couldn't find any labels that already existed, which is understandable because his feels niche. Getting one made is not an issue for me, I just wanted verification this was allowed.",

        "content": "Hi r/Logistics\n\nI consult for an organization that is looking for a US customs broker that can handle T86 entries for ecommerce for goods that cross the northern border by truck. Entry volume per day is around 5,000, increasing at peak. They ship six days a week, year round. Only a portion of these daily entries are on the table for this opportunity, but it is a permanent opportunity, and the percentage of entries to be filed as T86 will probably increase as regulatory ramps up in the US.\n\nThey're an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base. The client themselves holds all required FDA, Health Canada and other licenses or registrations. *This is not a marketplace like TEMU etc.* The clients have a mix of non-regulated and regulated products. Food, Dietary Supplements, general consumer household goods etc. COO is mixed but mostly COO US, Canada or China. These are currently cleared with a mix of S321, T86, informal and formal entries depending on the situation. They're looking for aggressive pricing from a broker well experienced in ecommerce that can handle mass submissions of entries (Excel template upload or API/EDI).\n\nThey're very savvy on compliance and IT fronts. The commodities don't change frequently - these are well known brands and products with long product lifecycles - again, this is *not* a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product day in, day out, each to a new consignee.\n\nDesired launch date is ASAP - they could start sending entries as soon as next week if the right partner is found.\n\nThey are looking to speak only with brokers who are well experienced with ecommerce T86. The daily trucking could be on the table in the future as well depending on the partner. This is potentially a multi-million dollar per year account for a brokerage / forwarder with the right service and product lineup. DM me for more detail and if you think you have a solution.",

I am with a large corporation and we serve external customers in rail exclusively. \n\nWhile I do enjoy this position, I plan on moving to another state in the next year or so. I am wondering if I should stay in rail because it is such a niche that takes time to learn and understand in depth or if I should be looking outside my experience? I know the skills are transferable in the logistics space, and serving external customers I could go into an array of account management for B2B but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nShould I be looking at jobs in rail or expand my horizons into other logistics roles such as procurement, trucking, etc. \n\nWho\u2019s hiring remotely or in the PNW?

I have a great team, and we\u2019re equipped to handle the work, but I just don\u2019t see how small and medium businesses are surviving this pressure.\n\nFor context, I (inherited and now) run a trucking company. We\u2019ve downsized our fleet recently because post-COVID demand dropped off, and the competition is fierce everyone seems to be fighting over even the lowest prices. It feels like an attrition war, and I\u2019m not sure how other companies make this work, is it even possible to work given the current market?\n\nHow do you manage the current situation?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

Ranges from simple intake to actual 4PL models.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. In/out - which should encompass everything as far as offload/reload, getting it to its spot and any sort labeling that they do internally.\n\n2. Storage - self explanatory \n\n3. Order Entry - so this every time an order is sent. It doesn\u2019t matter how many shipments this results in, there\u2019s a charge. \n\n4. Pick & Pack - this is if you client has multiple sku\u2019s and they send you FCLs/FTLs with one sku that eventually need to be broken down to create a pallet with multiple sku\u2019s on it.\n\n5. Additional material, labor, etc. - this is like pallet charges, wrapping charges, man labor if a container tipped over and you need someone to restack this etc.\n\nIf you do international: customs, ocean/air etc. is next. Then final mile charges. Then if you have a WMS system and they want to be able to login, you\u2019ll need to charge them an integration fee (and bump the order entry fee to make up for all the fees of them inputting loads now)\n\nFor reference, I own 200K sq ft in Miami. We have FTZ space and bonded space, the below is about an avg. charge per the above scope:\n\n1. $20/$20\n2. $35\n3. $22\n4. $0.65\n5. Varies\n\nHope this helps.",

My boss hated my email system (inbox zero) with folders for everything based on the segment (Shipper, Carrier, origin agent, destination agent, trucker, etc) I did this with 125 shipments a week, FCL, LCL and Air. Having it all organized made things so much easier. Combining that with Quick steps and reminders saved me sooo many headaches. \n\nUltimately you need to teach your people (origin, shipper, destination agent, trucker, etc) how you want/expect things. Once you get that done it runs smooth, things happen but as long as you plan and prepare you should be fine. If you don't do anything, that's when the stress happens. \n\nAutomate as much as you can and look at the process constantly to see how you can simplify it. \n\nI use Chat GPT and other AI programs hourly to make adjustments. \n\nCarriers will respond to you if you threaten to take the work if they aren't doing it to the level you need. Short pay for incorrect ppwk and be on the lookout for new carriers.",

If you designate 30 min time periods throughout the day for different task, you will find that you can dip into the most major parts of your AOR each day. You have to stick with it. If something urgent comes up and requires your immediate attention (always, I  know) then do it and return to your task window of time. \n\n2. Those of us that are diligent tend to take things personally when they don\u2019t go as planned. If there are things not under your direct control, let that shit go. I took all failures of other people and it ate me up. I\u2019m speaking mainly of internal operations like sales or finance. If it\u2019s a vendor making your life miserable, replace them. If it employees that report to you, replace them. But let what you can\u2019t fully control go.",

You know what will take 10 minutes and what will take 2 hours, not the person on the other end of the phone/email.\n\n\nPersonally, I start the day and bang out the quick tasks first. Then move onto the more detailed requests, and towards the end of the day start on the newest requests. \n\n\nI do get pulled away from this plan throughout the day to handle truly urgent and time sensitive items and that's ok. Handle that and then get back to the plan you made at the start of the day. \n\n\nAs other commentors have said, this is all about time management in the end and having an understanding of your abilities and your company and customers needs overall will help you navigate each day.

        "content": "I've been at my current job for seven years and been in the logistics role since 2020. All of my training was done in a month and all additional \"training\" has been done by myself finding free seminars and such. The company I work for has been doing worse and worse due to declining sales and issues getting materials. Plus, they refuse to pay for an ongoing training.\n\nSo, I'd like to start looking and training for a new job. Would prefer remote but willing to move to a blue state for a job (currently live in a deep red one). I'm making $51,000 in my current role.\n\nMy duties include:\n\n* Importing containers of finished goods from Central America (filling out ISFs for broker, coordinating with warehouse and 3PL for delivery)\n* Exporting containers of materials to Central America (making bookings, creating MBOLs and Commercial Invoices, filing the EEIs on the Automated Export System (AES), providing all paperwork to the 3PLs we use)\n* Coordinating with freight companies to get our air shipments picked up quickly and delivered on time to customers\n* Ensure we are following all rules/regulations for C-TPAT compliance\n\nI've saved my company thousands of dollars by changing what companies we use and how we move our goods/materials. I've made actual SOPs instead of the handful of handwritten scribbles I was given by the person who trained me. Convinced our company to get our shippers HAZMAT certified because the one person in our company who was HAZMAT certified had quit.\n\nSo, I've got some experience but I'm not sure what roles I should look for or work on training for. I doubt I'd be good at sales (have never been in a sales position). Since I've only been at one company with little training (outside of what free seminars I've found online), I don't really know what my chances are against people with degrees or multiple roles. I'm not looking to make bank, just be comfortable.",

Here are some potential roles and recommended training:\n\nSuggested Roles\n\n\t1.\tLogistics Analyst or Supply Chain Analyst\nYour experience with import/export, cost-saving, and SOP creation is directly relevant. Analysts often support data-driven improvements, helping companies optimize their supply chain and cut costs.\n\t2.\tImport/Export Compliance Specialist\nMany companies seek specialists familiar with ISFs, AES filings, C-TPAT, and hazardous materials. This role leverages your compliance knowledge and could allow you to expand into trade compliance.\n\t3.\tOperations Coordinator/Operations Specialist\nOften similar to logistics but with broader focus on day-to-day operations, process improvements, and cross-departmental coordination.\n\t4.\tLogistics Manager or Supply Chain Coordinator\nIf you\u2019re interested in management, these roles would allow you to use your SOP creation and coordination experience to lead a team or manage a segment of a larger supply chain.\n\nRecommended Training\n\n\t1.\tC-TPAT Certification & Export Compliance Training\nCourses in compliance will reinforce your understanding of regulations and could make you a more competitive candidate for roles emphasizing safety and compliance.\n\t2.\tFreight Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Training\nGaining more advanced knowledge in freight forwarding and customs brokerage (even if you won\u2019t be performing these roles) can broaden your logistics skill set.\n\t3.\tData Analytics in Logistics\nConsider a course in data analytics (e.g., Excel, Power BI, or Python for data analysis) to give you a competitive edge for analyst roles, helping you better track and report on logistics KPIs.\n\t4.\tProject Management Certification (PMP or CAPM)\nProject management can strengthen your ability to coordinate complex logistics operations. Even a basic certification can be beneficial.\n\nGeneral Tips\n\n\t\u2022\tHighlight Your Savings and Efficiency Contributions on your resume, as they are valuable to companies looking to improve margins and streamline processes.\n\t\u2022\tNetwork in Logistics Communities online or through free webinars. Engaging in forums and attending webinars can help you find job leads and keep up with industry trends.\n\nStarting with these roles and training can help you build a solid foundation for advancing in logistics or pivoting to a related area.",

We don't know what our volume will be. And I am going to assume we'd have 3-5 people working (mostly family and friends to start lol).\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions or input?",

Starting out, I'd recommend using ShipStation or similar solutions over Excel as your basic foundation.\n\nIn our early days, we used SkuLabs until we outgrew it. We then switched to SHero, which we've been using for the past 6 years. While SHero is comprehensive, it isn't cheap, so I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone just starting a 3PL.\n\nCurrently, we're exploring alternatives to SHero for various reasons (happy to discuss privately). Some options we've looked into include:\n\n* Warehance: A really solid and more affordable solution started by my friend who also used to use SHero\n* Packiyo: Created by an ex-SHero founder, seems fairly solid but lacked some features we needed\n* Logiwa: Another established option in the space\n\nWe've been moving over to Warehance and it's been working out really well for us. In this industry, you'll likely end up using one of the major players like SHero, Logiwa, or similar solutions as you grow.",

I really like Hopstack for the FBA part simply because the depth I have seen them go into with their Amazon flows. Dealing with Amazon is really tricky as everyone knows, and I have gone through switching many softwares before settling on Hopstack. Most importantly the customer service is awesome which is what you want from your WMS provider:\n\nHowever, I see that a lot of new merchants are also getting into starting prep businesses or starter 3PL businesses like yourself. Hopstacks main platform is prolly an overkill. So they have another product that was launched a while ago called Ignite that focusses on starter businesses. I\u2019ll highly recommend that. The alternatives that I have tried like scanpower, prepshiphub haven\u2019t been that great for my clients.\n\nYou can also stitch something together with excel and airtable, but the effort involved might not be worth your time. So I suggest keeping 200-300$ as a monthly budget for the software.",

                "content": "In order to make more money in the logistic space generally speaking, you need to move up from the line level into supervision and or leadership roles, or some kind of specialty role, like inventory management or IT. The first step in terms of determining where to go, is to look at your set of skills. What do you enjoy most about the job? What do you consider key strengths of yours? If you have a strong attention detail and are good with numbers inventory or financial analysis would be good places to explore. If you\u2019re a hard worker, dedicated and can show up every day, have good communication skills then looking to get into a lead role or management role would be something to consider. If you\u2019re great at written communication, email, problem solving and friendly on the phone. Client services would be something to consider. Once you determine what you think would be the best fit. The next step would be to talk to someone that you get along with on your leadership team. Explain to them that you\u2019re interested in career progression and you\u2019re willing to put in the work. Tell them that you think you would be good at whatever mightier might be and ask for their help, in getting some exposure to different opportunities. Some logistics companies have some type of management training programs that you might be able to participate in.  Minimally you could volunteer to assist whoever the lead person might be to start to get a better feel for a particular role so that you can understand if it\u2019s something you feel would be a good fit. When you can find something that you like, and that you\u2019re good at then work becomes a lot easier, and your career progression will be faster. All of these will pay you more than 45k a year and as you move up in higher management roles,, you could make 100K or more. Keep in mind that the trade-off for more money is always harder work in many cases longer hours and in almost all cases higher levels of responsibility that come with more pressure. That\u2019s just the trade-off in this business for higher wages.",

For immediate action, organizations deploy adaptive traffic signals, reroute traffic, and use live updates for drivers. Advanced technologies like AI-driven traffic cameras can detect bottlenecks and adjust traffic light patterns in real time. Long-term solutions include building alternate routes, improving public transit, and promoting staggered work hours to reduce peak traffic. Some cities also use congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter high-traffic zones. A mix of these strategies has proven effective in minimizing gridlock and keeping traffic flowing.",

My day to day is essentially as a dispatcher for our drivers and am basically a one man show for our freight brokerage operations. Truthfully, I am burnt out of operations and the complete and utter chaos that comes with both being asset based and running a brokerage. Im not really supported at my current company in that they wont hire anyone to help as we expand and frankly ownership runs things like it is the 1980s. It is like pulling teeth to modernize. Admittedly, freight is not our bread and butter as we are a distributor who delivers our own product more than we are a trucking company and the trucking and brokerage side exist just to support our distribution operations, so i am a bit of an afterthought and am expected to just move everything on a whim when we need more trucks for our outbound. Its an interesting idea to employ enough drivers and still have flexibility when outbound is slow. Im not upset at it, its what I was brought here to do but truthfully I am just burnt out from putting out fires with customers and managing drivers. I think I could have success in TMS software sales or support, where I can still use my knowledge of transportation and not be involved in the day to day of shipments, but thats just a thought. \n\nAnyone successfully transition out of operations and into a logistics adjacent role? If so, what are you doing now and are you doing well financially? ",

For the simple reason that our need moving product through the supply chain continues to grow.\n\nBack in 2020, many companies scrambled to find warehouse space to overcome the flow interruptions.  Some segments are seeing a retraction over the past year and this was not a surprise.  There are two main reasons.  First is that with the flow of goods restored to a more steady and reliable movement, there is less need to hold excess inventory and pay extra for contingency plans.  Second is that companies are reevaluating their supply chain networks to ensure the operations are optimized.  Many short-term decisions were made in 2020 that can be improved upon now that life is back to a more steady state.",

Also I was on the managerial and finance end of things, so my knowledge is better than most folks but slightly limited.\n\nLooking to import a new laptop for myself into South Africa from the US. It's exorbitantly expensive to buy it here (like $1k markup), so getting it from my family in the US is probably ideal. I am a US citizen too, so not just trying to nab a deal by importing from random countries.\n\nDHL has quoted me about $450 which is still extremely steep, plus any duties I might get hit with. Shipping it to a residential address so hopefully that will favor me there.\n\nCan anyone make any suggestions on a shipper or forwarder who could do this at a significantly lower cost? I know it won't be $50 but closer to $200 I can stomach.\n\nObviously as an alternative, some trusted friends are looking into visiting me here, and I'm asking to see when they might, and if they could bring it with them.\n\nGoing to reach out to some of my old forwarder contacts too. Thanks for any suggestions.",

The operations of a carrier get affected by the currency fluctuations that happen on a daily basis. Some currency changes can be so drastic that it affects the operability. This is addressed by the CAF. \nSome carriers, though few now, charge it as a % of the freight (they used to) but it is cumbersome to maintain so they have a lump sum dollar amount. It generally covers every situation but even if any drastic changes between one currency pair results in some operability issues it is compensated by the profit from another.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m looking for some advice on handling VAT and import costs for shipments we\u2019re sending from a factory in Hong Kong directly to a client in the Netherlands. We manufacture knitwear and ship large orders for fashion brands, but lately, we\u2019re getting hit with big charges on these shipments.\n\nWe\u2019re paying around 30% in taxes, including 21% Dutch VAT, plus additional import duties and fees, which brings the total cost to nearly 50% of the goods' value. This is really cutting into our margins, and since this client makes up a big chunk of our business (20-30% of our yearly turnover), we need to figure out a better way to handle these costs.\n\n**A few questions:**\n\n1. **Recovering VAT:** Is there any way to get the Dutch VAT back? We get billed for it by DHL after the factory handles shipping. Could registering for VAT in the Netherlands help with this, or is there another option?\n2. **Reducing Import Costs:** Any tips on reducing import duties or fees? Are there ways to optimize with tariff codes, trade agreements, or something similar?\n3. **Shipping Strategies:** Would changing how we ship or handle customs make a difference in terms of reducing costs? Has anyone dealt with something similar?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be really appreciated. This is a big client for us, but we need to make the numbers work better on these shipments.\n\nThanks in advance for the help!\n\n  \nEDIT: Sorry - I forgot to mention that we are based in the UK and our client is based in the UK. We send part of the shipment to their UK warehouse, and another part the their warehouse in the Netherlands. ",

They can get VAT reimbursement while you can't. For the duty, if any, he can pay it also and then seek reimbursement from you.\n\n  \nI have a customer who sends containers from Israel to Portugal. He agreed to Delivery Duty Paid with the BUYER. We clear the container using the Importer's VAT and charge the importer the duty. Then, we send the exporter a copy of the import customs clearance that shows the VAT/DUTY with instructions to reimburse the buyer for the duty.\n\n  \n[https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg)\n\nField 47  \nA00: DUTY, %6.5 on 32966.59\u20ac, 2142.83\u20ac.

The answer is yes, the only liability you incur is if CBP performs an inspection and the items they flag should have records of what it is and it's current entry status (inbond/cleared). Best practice is to outlay the flooring of your warehouse to clearly distinguish where bonded goods are stored. Usually, this is already setup as CBP performs accreditation checks when approving bonded facilities. Hope this helps!",
