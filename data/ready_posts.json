My boss hated my email system (inbox zero) with folders for everything based on the segment (Shipper, Carrier, origin agent, destination agent, trucker, etc) I did this with 125 shipments a week, FCL, LCL and Air. Having it all organized made things so much easier. Combining that with Quick steps and reminders saved me sooo many headaches. \n\nUltimately you need to teach your people (origin, shipper, destination agent, trucker, etc) how you want/expect things. Once you get that done it runs smooth, things happen but as long as you plan and prepare you should be fine. If you don't do anything, that's when the stress happens. \n\nAutomate as much as you can and look at the process constantly to see how you can simplify it. \n\nI use Chat GPT and other AI programs hourly to make adjustments. \n\nCarriers will respond to you if you threaten to take the work if they aren't doing it to the level you need. Short pay for incorrect ppwk and be on the lookout for new carriers.",

                "content": "Two main points from much experience here:\n1. Stress is often the bi-product of poor time management. Not always but often. If you designate 30 min time periods throughout the day for different task, you will find that you can dip into the most major parts of your AOR each day. You have to stick with it. If something urgent comes up and requires your immediate attention (always, I  know) then do it and return to your task window of time. \n\n2. Those of us that are diligent tend to take things personally when they don\u2019t go as planned. If there are things not under your direct control, let that shit go. I took all failures of other people and it ate me up. I\u2019m speaking mainly of internal operations like sales or finance. If it\u2019s a vendor making your life miserable, replace them. If it employees that report to you, replace them. But let what you can\u2019t fully control go.",

You know what will take 10 minutes and what will take 2 hours, not the person on the other end of the phone/email.\n\n\nPersonally, I start the day and bang out the quick tasks first. Then move onto the more detailed requests, and towards the end of the day start on the newest requests. \n\n\nI do get pulled away from this plan throughout the day to handle truly urgent and time sensitive items and that's ok. Handle that and then get back to the plan you made at the start of the day. \n\n\nAs other commentors have said, this is all about time management in the end and having an understanding of your abilities and your company and customers needs overall will help you navigate each day. There is always tomorrow and there is always more.",

Starting out, I'd recommend using ShipStation or similar solutions over Excel as your basic foundation.\n\nIn our early days, we used SkuLabs until we outgrew it. We then switched to SHero, which we've been using for the past 6 years. While SHero is comprehensive, it isn't cheap, so I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone just starting a 3PL.\n\nCurrently, we're exploring alternatives to SHero for various reasons (happy to discuss privately). Some options we've looked into include:\n\n* Warehance: A really solid and more affordable solution started by my friend who also used to use SHero\n* Packiyo: Created by an ex-SHero founder, seems fairly solid but lacked some features we needed\n* Logiwa: Another established option in the space\n\nWe've been moving over to Warehance and it's been working out really well for us. In this industry, you'll likely end up using one of the major players like SHero, Logiwa, or similar solutions as you grow.",

I really like Hopstack for the FBA part simply because the depth I have seen them go into with their Amazon flows. Dealing with Amazon is really tricky as everyone knows, and I have gone through switching many softwares before settling on Hopstack. Most importantly the customer service is awesome which is what you want from your WMS provider:\n\nHowever, I see that a lot of new merchants are also getting into starting prep businesses or starter 3PL businesses like yourself. Hopstacks main platform is prolly an overkill. So they have another product that was launched a while ago called Ignite that focusses on starter businesses. I\u2019ll highly recommend that. The alternatives that I have tried like scanpower, prepshiphub haven\u2019t been that great for my clients.\n\nYou can also stitch something together with excel and airtable, but the effort involved might not be worth your time. So I suggest keeping 200-300$ as a monthly budget for the software.",

My company is struggling with declining sales and material shortages, and they do not offer ongoing training support. Consequently, I am considering seeking new job opportunities and training. I prefer remote work but am open to relocating to a blue state from my current deep red one. I earn $51,000 in my current role, which involves importing finished goods from Central America (handling ISFs, coordinating with warehouses and 3PLs) and exporting materials (making bookings, creating MBOLs and commercial invoices, filing EEIs in AES, and providing paperwork to 3PLs). I also coordinate freight for timely air shipments and ensure compliance with C-TPAT regulations. I've saved my company thousands by optimizing our logistics and created actual SOPs from inadequate initial guidance. I also persuaded our company to certify our shippers in HAZMAT after the only certified employee left. While I have valuable experience, I'm uncertain about what roles to pursue or what training to focus on. I doubt I would excel in sales, as I have no experience in that area.

        "content": "Hello r/Logistics, I am consulting for a company seeking a US customs broker to manage T86 entries for e-commerce goods transported by truck across the northern border. They currently handle about 5,000 entries per day, with an increase during peak times, and ship six days a week year-round. While only a fraction of these entries are available for this opportunity, it is a permanent position, and the volume of T86 filings is likely to rise due to increasing regulations in the US. The client is an established e-commerce 3PL with a reliable client base and holds all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They deal with a variety of regulated and non-regulated products, including food, dietary supplements, and household goods, with most originating from the US, Canada, or China. Currently, they use a mix of S321, T86, informal, and formal entries. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in e-commerce, capable of handling bulk entry submissions via Excel or API/EDI. The product range is stable, featuring well-known brands with long lifecycles, and involves minimal imports of the same products to different consignees. They aim to launch ASAP, possibly starting as soon as next week if they find the right partner. They are interested only in brokers with significant experience in e-commerce T86. Future daily trucking opportunities may also arise based on the partnership. This could become a multi-million dollar account for a brokerage or forwarder that meets their service and product needs. Please DM me for more details if you think you can help.",
