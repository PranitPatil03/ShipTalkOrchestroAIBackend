They have an agent network and can arrange all the way through and will sort customs clearance for you. \nhttps://www.aglgroup.com/en/transport-logistics-africa/niger/\n\nYour documentation will need to be correct for the import. This is where most people have issues when shipping into West Africa. Also make sure you understand duty and taxes % so you don\u2019t get caught out. Request a DDP rate. (Delivered Duties Paid)\n\nGood luck",

YOU WANT the 60 percent all year around. don\u2019t let them fuck you over on DAS they like to sneak that one in.",

It is always better to work directly, our reps told us there is no direct contact if we use a 3PL and we\u2019ve definitely had moments where it was critical especially when it comes to the next day or other critical shipments, which it sounds like you might have. Never commit to large increases in volume if you play both sides tho. \n\nLike the other commenter said only one pickup is probably sufficient. Those trucks fit quite a bit inside them if you think you'll overload them. We shipped 600 individual parcels via UPS on Friday and just had our rep send over a box truck. \n\nAlso, I don't know if it's like this for all their customers but our LTL and parcel reps are always sending over pizza on Fridays. See if you can get them to swing those.",

However, I haven't found any software that meets these requirements. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks!",

    "content": "My family and I in the USA have hired a specialty printer in Taiwan to produce 500 copies of a relative's book for around $3000. The books will arrive in 15 boxes, each weighing about 9kg and measuring around 25 cm. The printer lacks experience with shipping to the USA, and I\u2019m unfamiliar with the import process. I want to send these books to residential addresses in the USA by air while minimizing customs fees. Since this is a group purchase and the books will be shared among family members, I think it might be best to have the printer issue 4 separate invoices and ship 3 or 4 boxes to 4 different family addresses. This way, each shipment would fall under the $800 de minimis threshold, potentially easing customs issues. Is this a good plan? Any other recommendations? Thanks!",

    "title": "could futures contracts help stabilize earnings across the shipping industry?",
    "content": "Futures contracts for commodities such as corn and cocoa help control price fluctuations, mitigate risks, and facilitate long-term planning. By standardizing contracts and establishing markets, futures exchanges create stability in industries with erratic pricing. Could this approach also benefit the broader shipping industry, including truck, ship, air, and rail freight? As an economics student, I wonder if freight rate futures could provide income stability for operators when rates fall below cost levels. I've noted average rates on sites like DAT Trendlines for trucking and assume other sectors experience similar challenges in managing operational costs and financial obligations. Futures contracts might be a viable solution. I would appreciate any insights on how this could apply to logistics and supply chain sectors. Thank you for your time!",

A lumber supply store in my hometown was bought a few years ago and has since declined, with contractors avoiding it due to poor management rather than the staff. I see an opportunity here as I want to enter local/short-haul trucking. The nearest city with better resources is 1.5-2 hours away, making supply runs time-consuming for contractors. I'm considering getting a tractor/trailer (likely a flatbed) to make weekly supply runs. Contractors can compile a list of needed materials, and I can pick them up and return. To address urgent needs, I plan to create a small lumber yard with common materials so contractors can save time. This would also serve as a staging area for pickups or deliveries with a smaller truck. My goal isn't to profit significantly but to support the contractors, as they're vital to the community's progress. However, I need to ensure enough participation to make this viable. Regarding pricing, trucking typically charges by the mile, but that may not cover my costs effectively. I anticipate doing vocational trucking as well, so this won't be my primary income source. I also consider charging a small fee for material storage, but I'm unsure how to approach pricing and would appreciate any advice or ideas. Thank you!",

This pricing is similar to how are customers are charging their client, so both parties can easily calculate and add their own margins. In your case, this would be more of a dedicated lane. Figure out the cost of handling this trip, vehicle maintenance, plate sticker, insurance, fuel, driver pay, waiting time, etc. once you know the minimum cost then you can calculate how you want to charge. If CPM structure makes sense then go for it. \n\nAlso besides service you will need to have a way to track orders, how you want to receive orders (same day request? Orders after 2pm?..etc), billing/invoice, dry run fees (accessories charges), maybe some products need to be handled with more labor and you need to add additional charges for handling. Insurance, damages, risk mitigation plans need to be thought of before they happen. Stolen/lost goods. I started off in a similar way. Good luck! it will take lots of dedication to grow if you can find a solid market to cater to.",

What are you going to do with your degree?  What are your career options with Modern Languages?  (It's a legitimate question and not intended to sound snarky.)  Now ask what your career options are with a degree in Supply Chain / Logistics.  Which of those paths appeals to you more?\n\nIf you look at the schools with the best Supply Chain Management / Logistics programs, they aren't the Ivy league schools.  Some of the top programs in the US include: Arkansas, Auburn, Michigan St and Penn St.\n\nIt's not so much the name itself that will help start your career.  A top program often has the networking and connections to solid employers who visit campus for recruiting.  When I found out my alma mater had a Top 5 program, I started making the recruiting trips and established a solid relationship.\n\nI'm not saying that only the top rated programs have those connections.  If you're looking at another school, look into their relationship with the business community.  Is there a good pipeline to help you find internships and your first job or is that all on your shoulders?  There are a couple smaller universities where I live that have great relationships with employers and I volunteer my time to mentor whenever possible.",

However, we lack a clear overview of responsibilities, which can lead to frustration and mistakes, particularly during the transition between teams. The main issue is determining when logistics should take over. I believe it should be when the supplier confirms that an item is ready for collection, ideally with a clear volume indicated, as logistics would then manage the process (most items are purchased ex works). Others think that logistics should start once the purchase order is placed and handle the supplier from that point. I would appreciate any insights, experiences, or frameworks you might have.

In countries like the U.S., USDOT numbers are required for interstate commerce, whereas in the EU, a company must register under the European Union Road Transport Regulation.\n\nDriver\u2019s License: Typically, drivers of heavy commercial vehicles will need a Commercial Driver\u2019s License (CDL) or the local equivalent, such as an HGV license in the UK or C+E Category licenses in the EU.\n\nWeight and Fuel Taxes: In some regions, such as the EU or Canada, vehicles operating across borders may require additional registrations like the International Registration Plan (IRP) or International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) in North America, but other countries may have their own systems or requirements.\n\nCountry-Specific Regulations: For instance, Brazil and other Latin American countries may have regional rules for road transport, particularly when it comes to taxation and cargo insurance, which can be quite strict. Countries like India may require permits for certain states when transporting goods across state lines.\n\nHazardous Materials Transport: Countries that are members of the United Nations\u2019 Dangerous Goods Regulations will often require special permits and driver endorsements for transporting dangerous or hazardous materials.",

        "content": "Reply 2 (my comment was too long)\n\nAir Transport (Private Carrier by Air)\n\nTransporting goods by air, whether domestically or internationally, involves significant security and regulatory oversight due to airspace control, customs regulations, and security requirements. Private air cargo operations (i.e., transporting your own goods via air) have specific requirements that differ from those of Indirect Air Carriers (IAC) that transport goods on behalf of others.\n\nCommon Requirements by Country/Region:\n\nAir Operator Certificates (AOC): In most countries, to operate an aircraft commercially (even as a private carrier), you need an Air Operator Certificate issued by the national aviation authority (e.g., FAA in the U.S., EASA in Europe, DGCA in India, or CAAC in China). This certificate ensures that the aircraft is airworthy, and all operational procedures meet international safety standards.\n\nIndirect Air Carrier (IAC) Registration:\n\nU.S./North America: In the U.S., an IAC license is required for entities arranging for goods to be transported via commercial aircraft on behalf of others. However, if you are shipping your own goods (e.g., an Etsy seller), you do not need this license as long as you're using third-party carriers like FedEx or DHL. The same logic applies globally\u2014third-party air freight companies handle security regulations, not the sender.\n\nEurope/Worldwide: In the EU and UK, companies such as DHL or UPS act as Regulated Agents under European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Security Regulations, so businesses sending their own goods through these agents do not require additional air transport licenses.\n\nCustoms and Security Clearances: Most countries, including those in the EU, Asia, and Africa, require detailed customs documentation for international air shipments. International aviation security measures, like those enforced by TSA in the U.S. and Transport Canada in Canada, demand compliance with screening requirements, but these are typically managed by the air carrier or freight forwarder.\n\nAirworthiness and Piloting: If you own and operate your own aircraft for shipping, your aircraft must meet the airworthiness standards of your national aviation authority (FAA, EASA, etc.), and pilots must have the proper commercial or private pilot\u2019s license.",

        "content": "Reply 3 (comment is too long)\n\nSea Transport (Private Carrier by Sea)\n\nShipping goods by sea involves additional layers of regulation depending on the waters and ports you operate in. Private shipping can range from operating small boats to larger vessels, and the regulations differ accordingly.\n\nCommon Requirements by Country/Region:\n\nMaritime Licensing (Worldwide): Operating a sea vessel, especially for commercial purposes, will require vessel registration and certification through national maritime authorities (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard in the U.S., Marine Maritime Organization (IMO) globally, European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in Europe, and local authorities in other countries).\n\nFla State Requirements: The flag your ship sails under will often determine the regulations you need to comply with. For instance, countries like Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands are known for their open registries where ship owners can register vessels under a foreign flag, which may have different rules and requirements than the country where the business operates.\n\nCustoms and Border Procedures: If you are transporting goods internationally, you will need to comply with customs regulations of both the exporting and importing country. These typically include filing for customs declarations, securing import/export permits, and following port security protocols. This is true for major ports in Asia (e.g., China, India, Singapore), Europe (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, UK), and Africa (e.g., South Africa, Kenya).\n\nDangerous Goods: Maritime transport of dangerous goods is regulated by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which most countries adopt. If you are shipping hazardous materials, you will need to follow these rules.\n\n\n\nAdditional Considerations Across Modes:\n\nInternational Trade Compliance: If you're shipping goods across borders, you'll need to comply with each country\u2019s import/export laws, which may include obtaining an Importer of Record status or export licenses (e.g., through CBP in the U.S. or HMRC in the UK).\n\nInsurance Requirements: Different countries may mandate cargo insurance depending on the value of goods and type of transport. For example, in Brazil, mandatory cargo insurance is required for all goods transported by road.\n\nInternational Conventions: Many countries adhere to international conventions that harmonize transport regulations, such as the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), Montreal Convention for air freight, and The Hague-Visby Rules for sea freight.",

    "content": "Hello everyone\u2014 I have a couple of questions for those with more experience than I have. (1) What are the typical per-mile delivery rates you charge customers? I understand many factors influence this, but I\u2019m mainly interested in food distribution. (2) How do mileage rates compare to IRS mileage reimbursement rates? Specifically, if your mileage earnings are lower than the reimbursement you can receive, can you use that reimbursement to reduce other income? For example, if I\u2019m a delivery driver paid only for the distance from Point A to B, but my reimbursement covers the trip to A, A-B, and back to A, can I apply that reimbursement to lower my taxable income elsewhere, like taxes on the goods I\u2019m delivering?

The brokerage will notify you that they can\u2019t find a truck for the quoted price and will increase the price to the \u201cmarket rate\u201d which is actually 2-3x higher.  \n\nThere are many great carriers and brokerages to choose from in the auto transport industry but unfortunately there are also some bad characters that utilize this \u201cbait and switch\u201d business model of: send low quotes, collect security deposit, increase price.\n\nDefinitely do some research on the industry to avoid any headaches or scams.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to review more options, we have 3 different price options.

These companies work in a way that is totally different from freight forwarders and are heavily integrated vertically. \n\nFor your question, the answer will vary between countries. Each country has its own regulations.\n\nIn Canada, you can have the carrier or any other custom broker clear imports by courier. Using an alternate is a bit more expensive, not necessarily slower and you get a more personalized service (thus less errors).\n\nIn the USA, you can have an alternate custom broker clear the import, but it'll take a couple of extra days and there's no cost saving. In my experience, it's easier to have the courier clear it then do a post-entry correction.\n\nI can't say for other countries.",

Once the container has arrived into the port, it'll be discharged from the vessel after a few working days, the company you have contracted to move your goods will then take the container to a \"devan\" shed which is a freight term for unloading containers. They'll unpack all the goods, and palletise them as per each customer. They'll let you know when it's unpacked and cleared customs, and you can arrange for the goods to be delivered to your final destination (your door) from there.\n\n  \nThings to look out for:\n\nEnsuring the goods you've purchased are sent via DDP (Delivered duty paid) so there are no further charges once they reach the US, unless you've already worked out the incoterms. DDU is duty unpaid, and you'd be liable to pay duty charges to customs (not sure the rates for US) for the goods to be released. Just be careful that you understand the incoterms before purchasing goods & shipping them. \n\n  \nSince you'll be booking via LCL, there is a bunch of other goods for other people within the container.. Not sure if it's the same for US, but in the UK, we have bonded warehouses also known as ETSF's, whereby the container can be taken off quay to a devan shed before all the goods have cleared. This is what you want, as if you're stuck in a smaller freight forwarders container and someone elses goods are chosen for customs checks etc, your freight will be stuck with it until all other goods have cleared.\n\n  \nInsurance...

While I appreciate the income, my mental health has suffered significantly, impacting my family life with my wife and two kids. I work about 60 hours a week and commute three hours daily since my company won't allow remote work. Recently, they started micromanaging me, despite my strong performance. My approach has been to make cold calls and nurture leads, often stepping in to handle operational tasks due to understaffing. However, my sales management insists I should only focus on sales. I'm seeking a new job, ideally outside this industry, with a minimum salary of $120,000 to maintain my current lifestyle. Any advice?",

Are they legally allowed to charge us after delivery? Shouldn\u2019t they have informed us of this discrepancy before shipping, so we could consider other options? Since this wasn\u2019t communicated beforehand, I don\u2019t see how we can agree to pay this fee. I\u2019m searching online for information but can\u2019t find any.

Why does it make sense for the package to arrive 38 miles away, travel 100 miles in the opposite direction, and then return to me? Can someone explain this?",

    "content": "I have a 15-year-old DigiWeigh shipping scale that can weigh up to 75 lbs for occasional shipping of packages and letters. While it functions adequately, its accuracy is limited to about 0.2 oz. Additionally, I own a 5lb USB scale that I no longer use, as I stopped using it some time ago. I'm looking for a recommended integrated shipping scale for letters and small packages (up to 30 lbs) that offers better accuracy (0.1 oz or finer) and can directly connect with various shipping platforms. By \"directly connects,\" I mean it should either communicate with the shipping platform so that when I weigh an item, the correct amount automatically appears on the shipping platform, or it should allow for easy input with a button press. For instance, a USB scale could emulate a keyboard, entering values like \"2.15\" for 2.15 lbs or \"8\" for 7.9 oz. The scale should be automatic but will require software, and since I use online shipping platforms, it likely needs to emulate a keyboard.",

If any item exceeds $100, the whole package may incur duties. I declared the total as 3 plush toys for $250, 10 keychains for $50, 20 stickers for $50, and 20 art prints for $30, totaling over $300. I used the total cost instead of listing individual item values. Am I in trouble? I really don\u2019t want him to have to pay anything; that would be awkward!",

I have a preliminary quote from FedEx for shipping, but I'm unsure about the necessary paperwork (export certification, special packaging requirements, etc.), and FedEx requires an invoice even for personal items.

Initially, everything went smoothly; the package was handed to GLS, processed, and reached the distribution center in Germany by October 18th. However, since then, it has been \u201cin transit\u201d with no updates. I've attempted to contact GLS via their website and email, but I've received no replies. As of October 28th, I still don't know the whereabouts of my package or when it will arrive in the Netherlands. Has anyone else faced similar delays with GLS for international shipments?

However, I\u2019m struggling to find one that works and costs under a thousand dollars. I don't need it to fold, stuff, or lick envelopes, but I need a combination of 1. a service for printable stamps, compatible with 2. software that can import our address list (I can write a script to convert a CSV if necessary), and 3. a printer that can handle 20 or more greeting card envelopes and print labels with about 95% accuracy. I've done some research and found some options, but I'm worried about compatibility issues, like whether the service exports in a usable format, requires individual printing, or if the printer only accepts one envelope at a time. Does anyone know of a compatible set or any individual components that might work?",

    "content": "I'm planning to purchase a wearable blood pressure monitor that isn't available in the US and will have it shipped from Germany, where it's currently only sold. Forward2Me requires a driver's license and utility bill for shipments from Germany, citing German law, but my research indicates this law doesn't apply to reshipping businesses. I've also found another reshipper that doesn't ask for this sensitive information. I'm considering using Shipito, which ships from Austria without requiring personal details. I'm looking for recommendations for other reliable reshippers from Germany or Austria. Does anyone have suggestions?",

    "content": "The issues stem from storage fees, poor practices that contradict their own terms (though this is debatable), and delays in registering packages. According to their policy, Premium members get 30 days of free storage, while Basic members receive 5 days. However, in practice, if a package sits for 5 days, they still charge storage fees afterwards, even for parcels that have been there less than 5 days. For instance, I was charged for a package that was logged just one day before billing. They also deducted money from my PayPal account without notice. I had delays due to incorrect logging of contents and a package that was never logged, which is now considered lost. This situation forces me to incur additional shipping costs. \n\nThe company's practices seem designed to maximize profit from free members by ensuring they exceed the 5-day limit, resulting in storage fees. They also delay package registration, leading to additional fees. Overall, I anticipate spending an extra $75 due to these issues, including unauthorized storage charges and increased shipping fees. Even premium members face similar problems, as I experienced last year when packages took 30-45 days to log, leading to significant extra costs. I had hoped to give them another chance, but I won't be using their services again.",

However, even if you (if you are the sender), mark it as a gift, you still have to declare the full fair market value of all of the goods in the shipment.

I transitioned to inventory work due to retail experience and now find myself in logistics/supply chain coordinator roles, which involve order processing, customer communication, basic freight booking, incident processing, and collaborating with accounting and procurement to resolve inventory issues, primarily in the food CPG sector. I'm unhappy in my current position, not due to the nature of the work, but because of my environment. I see this career as a stable income to help achieve my goals. I have several questions: \n\n1. How can I transition to a more appealing industry? I'm interested in toys, games, and music but get quickly rejected when applying outside food.\n2. Is there a way to work internationally? I don't speak other languages but am willing to learn. I'm particularly interested in East Asia but am open to other regions. I assume import/export could be a pathway, but I'm unsure how to acquire that skill.\n3. If relocating abroad isn't an option, is there fully remote work available? How can I find it?\n4. What are the best job boards for these roles?\n5. What's a cost-effective, short way to enhance my skills? I feel my skills are fragmented due to my unconventional background and I often feel outmatched by supply chain MBAs. I'm not a data expert, but I\u2019m practical and can improve with some guidance.

Is there a standard procedure that all companies should follow, or is everyone just inventing \"creative\" solutions as problems arise?

I've seen managers and executives with certifications who struggle to plan production schedules or understand MRP. They're great at attending meetings and making noise, though. After eight years, I still feel uncertain about my role and the real impact of my Excel spreadsheets, only hearing about earnings and goals quarterly.

    "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019ve read various accounts about the CPIM exam and want to share my experience to help others. My job covered the cost of an online course and the exam (including a retake), and I successfully passed on my first attempt with a score of 319 earlier this week. I don't have a background in supply chain or manufacturing, and prior to the course a year ago, I had no knowledge of the subject. I've been a production and supply planner for 18 months.\n\nRegarding studying: Everyone has their own learning style. For me, the classroom experience wasn\u2019t very beneficial; the material was dry, and the effectiveness seemed to depend on the instructor's quality. I realized early on that I would need to depend on the textbooks and online resources. Although I completed the instructor-led course out of respect for my employer, I believe I would have been better off just reading the books. I spent eight weeks re-reading all three books before the exam, taking online tests, and focusing on my weakest areas. A crucial part of my prep was reviewing the exam content manual a few days before the test and noting down concepts I struggled with. I used ChatGPT to get brief definitions and summaries for those concepts, which helped me pick up many easy points on the exam that I might have otherwise missed.\n\nThe week before the exam, I scored between 60-80% on practice tests. I felt unprepared and even tried to reschedule the exam two nights before, but couldn't. Fortunately, that worked out for me. \n\nFor the exam itself, I took it in person and arrived early, which they accommodated. I used the provided noise-canceling headphones, which were helpful. You have 3.5 hours, and I finished in 1.5 hours. The questions include straightforward ones, but many are frustratingly worded, leading to educated guesses on about a third to half of the exam. My strategy was to narrow down to the top two options and trust my instincts, which felt unsettling but ultimately led to success. The exam's language and style differed significantly from the course materials, making it feel like it was created by a different group.\n\nAfter the exam, you complete a five-minute survey, which can be frustrating while waiting for results. I received my scores immediately, ranging from 67% to 95% across different topics, but individual experiences may vary based on exam difficulty. Familiarity with common formulas is helpful, as the questions often provide a",

However, I'm wondering which option would lead to a well-paying job that allows for a comfortable living. Specifically, what entry-level salary can I expect from supply chain analytics/management with two internships, and what about the Quant role? \n\nTo clarify, I interned last summer at a major retail company as a supply chain analyst and now have four offers: one from a Michigan-based manufacturing company, one from a top bank, one from a mid-sized software firm, and the last from a second-tier bank offering the Quant role. While pay isn't my current concern, it will be post-graduation. Considering all this, which internship would you choose to secure an entry-level job with a salary of at least $75k to $80k after college?",

Below is just an example of the thought exercise. \n\nSupply Chain Operations: finished school, and looked around the job market for a slightly above entry level position. School allows for a leg up against non degree applicants, and your experience in a factory shows hands on knowledge of physical things. You will have chosen between x y and z companies, and possibly a b and c industries. You\u2019ve done your research and let\u2019s say decided to take an analyst position at Trillium Health Partners. You\u2019re making $75k per year (avg salary in Ontario for an analyst at Trillium). Your career path is likely a slow one, but steady. THP is booming and has a bright future. AI has taken its niche and will continue to grow, but you\u2019ve protected against that by choosing a job that is complex enough to not be directly replaced by AI. In 10 years, if you want to manage people, you\u2019re a Sr Manager and are making $125k with bonus. \n\nAccounting: you\u2019ve finished your degree and have a wide variety of choices of industries and companies. You knew that AI would have a very large impact on this sector, so you\u2019ve decided to take a position as a cost analyst, which combines complex operational planning as well as accounting knowledge. You\u2019re working on mitigating costs for Loblaw\u2019s supply chain group. You\u2019ll find it harder to stay with one company, since these accounting roles are very competitive and some of the first to be outsourced or downsized, so you\u2019ll need to change roles every few years to go up the ladder. In 10 years, you\u2019re a Senior Finance Manager at Nestl\u00e9 and making $165k with bonus. \n\nThese are just examples of course, but I\u2019d encourage you to write this out and do the research as if it were 5 years from now, Halloween 2029. Once you finish, what does your life outside of work look like? What do you like to do? Do you have a family? \n\nThen sit with this vision of the future for a few days and rewrite it as you think of different things or find new things in your research. Maybe you have two visions and you are choosing which is best. \n\nAfter all that, your gut/heart will guide you on what\u2019s best. Trust in your truth about what you want your life to be, and pick a career that enables you to do those things. Don\u2019t pick your career to fulfill you in life, pick a career that gives you the opportunity to be fulfilled in the rest of your life beyond work.",

I applied for a master's program in supply chain management but was waitlisted. I recently had my third interview for a data analyst position but haven\u2019t received an update in 5 days. I've had to accept a role as a shipping line lead, which I dislike, as it was one of the few offers I received after over 20 applications on Indeed and LinkedIn.

I'm considering obtaining an APICS certification to enhance my qualifications, as I excel in operations and data analysis but haven't found a position that appreciates my experience.",

My role involves acting as a liaison between suppliers and customers, handling load scheduling, tracking ETAs, and maintaining relationships. I collaborate closely with our sales team, which focuses on new business and pricing. I've received positive feedback for my performance, especially considering my limited experience, and I enjoy my job. However, I often find myself unfairly blamed for issues beyond my control from both suppliers and customers. Recently, we lost a new supplier account due to delayed pickups, despite my repeated requests to prioritize these loads. The sales representative in charge of this account has been passive-aggressive towards me, and while I followed the correct procedures, the situation reflects poorly on me. Although our leadership is also addressing this with our logistics broker, I'm left feeling that my reputation is at risk. I generally believe in taking responsibility for failures, but I'm struggling with this situation. I would appreciate any advice on handling similar challenges and improving my approach.",

I got a job in purchasing back in January of this year, 2024, and I honestly kind of regret it. It does have its perks compared to my old job. I used to work in a retail store where my main job was dealing with inventory. I still had to run the \u201csales floor\u201d, so I still dealt with people, both employees and customers, but thankfully I did spend a lot of my time in the back working on inventory (inbound and outbound) and this most certainly gave me a GREAT understanding of the most basic fundamentals. Coming back to my current job, I honestly don\u2019t like it. Purchasing is doing the same exact thing every single day and then finding lost shipments that are, of course, always the most expensive ones. I wish I had chosen a different industry, but that\u2019s a me thing. That being said, I\u2019ve been trying to spend as much time as I can, without neglecting my duties, out in the warehouse, lending a hand, watching, and even just hanging out with the warehouse folks. Because I understand that 1. They handle my sh*t, it pays to be nice to them. And 2. They\u2019re human and deserve more than my snarky emails about why my stock for this item hasn\u2019t been scanned in yet.

    "content": "Hi everyone! I have around 6 years of experience in the restaurant industry, including 1.5 years managing inventories and orders for multiple locations, implementing new inventory software, and training staff during a transition. Currently, I work as a bartender in a large hotel with great benefits that aren't available in restaurants, but I want to avoid a lifetime of weekend night shifts. The restaurant environment isn't ideal for my happiness either. A purchasing manager position has opened up, which aligns with some of my experience, though it involves mainly food ordering, something I'm not familiar with. The previous hire left shortly after starting, which raises concerns since he came from another hotel. However, my manager, who previously held this role, assured me I could learn it despite my lack of direct experience. What are your thoughts on the long-term prospects of this position? I don\u2019t want to be stuck in an entry-level management role forever, especially since upward movement is limited due to the department\u2019s ties to accounting. I see potential for growth into hotel operations management as I develop my financial skills. Additionally, would experience in hotel purchasing be applicable to other industries? I don\u2019t have a degree, but I\u2019m open to pursuing relevant certifications, although I may struggle with a degree due to past challenges in school. Thanks for your advice!",

    "content": "The U.S. warehouse market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. After an unprecedented surge fueled by e-commerce during the pandemic, the market is now facing a slowdown characterized by increasing vacancy rates. This raises the question: is this a temporary setback or a long-term change? In 2020, with e-commerce sales jumping over 30%, warehouse space was in high demand, leading major companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Target to expand their fulfillment networks, resulting in a national vacancy rate as low as 3.4%. However, vacancy rates have now climbed to 6.4%, the highest since 2014. Several factors contribute to this shift: 1. Overbuilding and Reduced Demand: Companies added substantial warehouse space during the pandemic, but much of it now sits empty as demand has stabilized. 2. Impact of Rising Interest Rates: Increased interest rates are making it difficult for developers to pursue new warehouse projects, causing a notable decline in speculative construction. 3. Changes in E-commerce Patterns: While online sales continue to rise, the growth rate has slowed down to a more moderate level.",

Don't advertise your product though, instead, add value to the conversations. Might try to tastefully try to use your product in examples of how you address someone's question. Otherwise if you try to sell something, most groups worth being in will ban you.\n\n Also, keep your eye out for anyone asking about your type of product and DM them directly.",

It's easy to do on paper and you sketch it out. But weird when you have to do it on the stupid whiteboard. Same with exponential smoothing. Although it's just 3 or 4 lines so it's not that bad.  \n  \nMost of the math is pretty straight forward, so don't worry too much about it. Know the EOQ formula. Make sure you know how to do a long version of TAKT time. And know that stupid accounting formula for payables + days outstanding. They try to get tricky with the terminology so be ready for that. Maybe run a few scenarios thru ChatGPT.  \n  \nSo, STAY POSITIVE THRU THE ENTIRE TEST! That's my big tip. You'll hit a patch of rough questions and you'll start getting frustrated. Don't! Stay calm and keep going. I almost ruined my test because I was getting angry. LOL.  \n  \nDon't flag too many questions. You'll be tired at the end and won't want to deal with them at the end.  \n  \nAnd...have a bathroom plan man! Seriously. The test is 3.5 hours and there is no break (Stupid I know). I almost just went on the floor. lol. After about 2.5 hours it got brutal. So don't drink too much or wear your APICS approved adult diaper. I couldn't review my flagged questions.

It pays your tuition and a bit for basic living expenses. A semester of a Chinese immersion course of 15 hours a week it roughly $1200 USD (without living expenses). Every major city in Taiwan has a few different universities that offer these programs. If you don't qualify for the scholarships you can just pay the tuition yourself.

Eventually, I was reassigned to the export department due to staff shortages. It turned out to be a stressful, operational role, and I struggled with the office politics and workload.

I averaged about 70% on Learning Center and Pocket Prep quizzes, and 74% on the final practice test. While these resources are helpful, the actual exam is more straightforward and focuses on identifying the \"more\" correct answer. My main advice is to read the material thoroughly 1-3 times. I used the Speechify app to listen to the books while driving or walking, which was beneficial. It's vital to understand how the concepts connect. The quizzes and practice tests are good for checking comprehension, but I only saw 4-5 similar questions on the exam. For the math section, be sure to know basic formulas, how to explode a BOM, moving averages, exponential smoothing, and capacity (both demonstrated and efficiency). Good luck to all studying!

While I\u2019ll gain valuable experience and have a good salary, being so far from loved ones isn\u2019t what I envisioned for starting my career. I've only shared this with my family since I can\u2019t discuss it at work. I'm feeling really down about it.",

My (now) wife was excited about the location, I was excited, we spent a weekend figuring out where we'd want to look for housing. \n\nDuring training, everytime I mentioned the location, people gave me weird looks, saying \"huh interesting...\" or, \"wonder what that's about\".\n\nI finally spoke up to our program manager and asked what the deal was. They got the cart before the horse and offered me a location they were hoping to have via acquisition, but it fell through. So they reassigned me, to an extremely remote corner of the country (we were 4 hours from a commercial airport!).\n\nMind you, I already signed a 2 year commitment with significant penalties if I walked away. I called my then girlfriend and gave her an out - I was stuck but she could bail if she needed to. She fortunately did not, and moved with me and we were there for 4 years. \n\nThat was the *best* decision either of us ever made. We made lifelong friends, we figured out how to be an adult with our families more than 18 hours away, and I made connections professionally that have absolutely paved the path I'm on now.\n\nI get your apprehension and frustration - been there to an extent. Look at it as an opportunity. Kinda sounds like this might be your first time moving away from home - embrace it! Sometimes, moving far away from family is the best thing for you to grow as a human and professionally. It's OK to be pissed or homesick - but now is your chance at a young age to figure out who *you* are without the noise of family nearby.",

If it's the company I suspect it is, continually moving you all over the country with little care about your preferences is part of the culture and you are better off leaving if you would rather have stability in your life. \n\nIf you do decide to bite the bullet and take the relo, make sure you are crystal clear on the terms of it. Most companies have a claw-back period of 12-18 months for relo costs if you leave or are fired for cause.  I've seen people get royally screwed in relos they weren't happy with because it affected their performance which put them at the top of the list at layoff time. It sucks getting fired, but it REALLY sucks getting fired in a strange place 9 hours from home with no family, no contacts, and no stipend to get back to where you want to be. \n\nSince you are already considering leaving if you are forced to relo, have a frank talk with your manager or HR about what's going on. They may tell you to pound sand, but they may also decide it's not worth the pain in the rump to replace you so they will give some credence to your preference. You don't get what you don't ask for.",

They ran a dairy, raised sheep for wool, and planted corn. \n\nThe problem is that \u2018natural\u2019 is now a specialized niche, and it\u2019s much more expensive than regular commercial farming. Sometimes growers and producers make questionable choices to just stay afloat. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that \u2018child\u2019 labor is traditionally utilized on farms. You have kids, and they help out around the farm as soon as they\u2019re able. One of these reasons traditional farms are dying is because there\u2019s a better life to be had, so kids don\u2019t get into farming. My dad had 3 kids, none of us do anything remotely farm related. Dad tried raising my nephew into the traditional ways, he wanted nothing to do with it. \n\nI could drone on for days about agriculture, but it\u2019s not ultimately a very productive conversation.",

        "content": "Natural is a labeling definition.  Consumers associate the term natural with lots of other ideas...if it's better for me, it must be better for the planet and it's people right?  Many brands do have an ethos of responsibility and sustainability, and those are also more likely to have a cleaner label and  promote being natural. \n\nThe term natural doesn't directly correlate with how that product or company impacts the planet or society.  There can be artificial products that are very sustainable and ethical. And some natural products that aren't.\n\nTwo things to consider: Natural and artificial products are both derived from a plant or animal source.  And both are made at a very very large scale. High volumes and economies of scale are required to grow big enough to reach the grocery store.  Even a 'small' brand is leveraging global sourcing and large scale production, either as part of a larger company or through a co-man.   And at that level, that means lots of suppliers and a fairly sizeable carbon footprint. (There are billions of mouths to feed!)\n\nOne thing I can assure you, both the ethical, regulatory, quality, financial, and environmental impact are routinely discussed at all levels of the industry.  Brands both big and small are having these discussions every time they roll out a new product or even a change in ingredient.  And suppliers are scrutinized quite closely to ensure compliance. (You're ultimately responsible for everything you put in your product. You wouldn't be in business long if you didn't do your due diligence).  \n\nThe difference would be how much weight is assigned to one of these factors. They are all part of the calculus. Some companies certainly make decisions that are not the best option financially, if it fits with their brand or values. No matter how much passion you have for the planet, any successful company still has to find a balance between that and the other factors like cost, quality, etc. \n\nAsk yourself what the perfect product would be from an environmental or ethical perspective.  Assume you could source everything locally and ethically, offset the carbon required to produce the energy to cook it, pack it in paper made from renewable plants, and deliver it on bicycles or sailboats. The most passionate consumers might appreciate your level of effort. And the wealthiest of those consumers might even be able to afford it. But the vast majority of your target market cannot afford a $35 loaf of perfectly sustainable bread. \n\nSo like any industry, food companies can and do take steps to limit the impact, while also ensuring they are affordable to consumers and profitable as a company.  As with anything this big, there is still massive room for improvement. Plenty of waste and inefficiency exists. \n\nTo be truly \"natural\" and still feed billions of people is going to require more than just industry.  Especially in developed countries where consumers demand cheap, fast, and readily available food in great abundance. It's hard enough getting shoppers to give up their plastic grocery bags. \n\nBut it is absolutely being talked about. It's not just a buzzword and it's not limited just to natural products.  At least I hope it is because I just spent 12 hours in sustainable procurement training last month! \n.",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I'm 24 and from Italy, currently working in a junior Supply Chain position in the spare parts division of an automotive company, where I've been for four months. My role involves order management and logistics, including managing supplier relationships, tracking deliveries, and organizing inbound shipments. I plan to enhance my Excel skills, particularly with Power Query, in the future. Previously, I worked for 14 months as a Sourcing & Costing Assistant at an outdoor shoe company, collaborating with Asian suppliers on product development and collections. I enjoyed negotiating costs, exploring new materials, sourcing suppliers, and attending trade fairs, while my boss frequently traveled to Asia. I began my career as an intern but left to focus on my studies and explore other opportunities. Although my current job is building my technical logistics and supply chain skills, I miss the R&D involvement, travel opportunities, and hands-on experience from my previous role. I'm curious if there are positions that integrate supply chain and R&D, allowing me to leverage my logistics skills and background. I hold a bachelor's in Economics and I'm in my final year of an International Management MSc. Thank you for your advice!",

Different methods have different benefits but consistency is most important. I\u2019ve used pallet locations and average inventory based on month end counts. Could even do something on throughput but then fast movers get penalized. Finance team probably has a preference and way they are allocating overhead already so try and mirror that.",

The role involves using demand to inform rack placements, which is similar to my past experience with materials, and I believe my skills are transferable. The hiring manager provided feedback for my next interview and set an onsite date, which I'm preparing for. I\u2019m also considering reaching out to the full-time capacity planner at the site for more information, but I'm unsure if it's appropriate.",

Don\u2019t waste time trying to justify why you got the interview. You got it. We don\u2019t need to dissect why or analyze whether you\u2019re qualified or not. The only thing I did see that was important was your guess that they want you to hit the ground running. That can be a bad thing - a lot of companies really dislike training now so you may get pushed off a cliff. Hopefully it won\u2019t put you over your head.\n\nContracts will vary by company, so no one will know for sure how it works. In general, a lot of companies are doing this currently now because it allows them to simply drop you if you don\u2019t end up being exactly what they\u2019d imagined for the role or their business gets slow and they want to get rid of salary expenses. Basically go into it understanding that you can be ended at any time with little explanation unfortunately.",

There are going to be people applying for jobs that have no internship at all, so don\u2019t stress about it. Outside of your internship you can do some volunteer or business frat work in college to beef up your resume. Like it\u2019s been said, don\u2019t stress it too much.

Talk to someone in procurement, learn their day to day, and ask questions , you could potentially get asked at an interview. \n\nOn your resume, change the title of your position to procurement intern or along the line of that. And add some responsibilities related to procurement that you can speak too. Just gotta make it believable. \n\nI personally would advise you to get into management of some sort, way , way more money. \n\nI\u2019ll probably get downvotes or someone is going to act like the description mentioned above. But switching/pivoting all depends on your responsibilities and job title on your resume. And background checks ONLY CHECK if you worked at a conpany or not. They don\u2019t care about your title, nor your manager, just if you worked there.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re white, with majority of the people in you department sectors being white, just socialize and you\u2019ll be able to pivot just as easily",

Reviewing samples for overall quality to see if they match the specs. Entering in the details of the product into some kind of product master or purchase order. Things like that could be automated. \n\nRegarding assistant buyers being made obsolete, fashion executives aren\u2019t stupid, and they\u2019re not going to diminish their bench strength for short term gains (well the smart companies won\u2019t). If they automated away assistant buyer roles, and people coming out of FIT or wherever had no place to go, these companies would be killing themselves slowly by not developing a bench for when their existing buyers attrition. They may reduce headcount overall, but they\u2019re not going to just do away with it. \n\nCertain other functions like parsing out under performers, analyzing seasonal trends and the like could also be automated. \n\nBut I think the core of fashion buying is relationships and a human intuition on trends and styles. As creative as \u201cAI\u201d can be, there\u2019s an undeniable human element to market makers and following the market maker trends. Haute couture designers set the trends a year or two out, and then depending on where your brand fits into the life cycle of a garment trends, you\u2019re either riding the wave immediately or tracking how the trends roll downstream over time into mass apparel markets. All of this is a very human and relationship driven business. I don\u2019t see any AI, even on the horizon that would be capable of replacing this. It could help analyze it and speed up the life cycle, but not replace. \n\nCould a brand choose to go full AI and just have some Midjourney type system create trends for them? Definitely, and that\u2019ll probably happen. It\u2019ll have niche popularity, but not big enough to upset the industry. \n\nTl;dr certain mechanical functions of the buying process will definitely be automated, and assistant buyer jobs could diminish, but the core of fashion buying probably won\u2019t. \n\nSource: Director of Supply Chain in fashion",

My attempts to describe it as having extra flaps have not been successful. Additionally, I would appreciate recommendations for UK-based packaging suppliers who can assist. I understand there may be tooling costs, and I'm planning an initial run of 500 to 1,000 boxes to test the market, so I expect costs to be higher than bulk orders.

To avoid redrawing 80% of the first design, I want to save it under a new name and modify it. I've deleted the old bottom, but when I tried to remove the related variables, ArtiosCAD wouldn't allow it. It seems the variables are still referenced in the file's history (Help > Diagnostics > Edit log), even though I've deleted that part of the drawing. What\u2019s the correct way to remove the old design elements and their variables to clear space for the new ones without creating confusion?",

But if you distribute via a warehouse you\u2019ll likely want longer shelf life. \n\nI recommend using a vacuum sealer machine as this will pull vacuum for air tightness and seal the bag for tamper evidence.

When I raised my concerns, they only provided their specifications and refused to investigate. After some research, I discovered SorbentSystems (also known as IMPAK). A sales representative engaged with me about my order and suggested testing their absorbers against Weissorbent's. They shared quality assurance data, which revealed that Weissorbent's desiccants were significantly less effective than claimed. Since then, I've been very satisfied with SorbentSystems; their team is responsive, and their products meet my needs perfectly. In short, if you're in the packaging industry, consider trying IMPAK. We've made the switch, and our dried goods are thriving.",

I\u2019m proficient in Solidworks and have extensive experience in packaging design for manufacturing. While my current role focuses on folding cartons and corrugated materials, I also have experience with tins and vacuum-formed packaging. I aim to leverage more of my skills and influence overall design, aspiring to work on complete package structures. For instance, a recent pair of earbuds I bought featured a folding carton, a complex paperboard insert, a vacuum-formed insert, and a structured envelope for the manual. I want a role that heavily involves design and engineering decisions. However, I\u2019ve learned from a packaging engineer at a major consumer goods company that their job mainly focuses on sourcing, ERP, and project management, with little design involvement. Many design positions I see concentrate more on branding and graphics, while structural design roles in the US often lean towards consumer packaged goods and food packaging, which I find less appealing. I prefer to design packaging for durable products like toys or electronics. What job titles and companies should I target? Do I need further education, or can I transition with my current experience? \n\nUpdate: I recently secured a new position as a structural designer on the supplier side, where the company handles various packaging types, including primary packaging like bottles and jars. Although it\u2019s not my ideal job, I am utilizing more of my skillset, and I\u2019m satisfied with my decision after a few months and plan to stay for a few years.",

        "content": "Hi,\nI work for a CPG but I lead the entire packaging team which includes womb to tomb development. This means design through to manufacturing. Most CPG companies divide out their packaging groups by front end and back end. This means that front usually works with marketing to execute designs (sourcing, technical development with sourcing partners, some testing, approvals, artwork, and so on). Back end is all the other stuff once the development is over (manufacturing,  filling, testing, tertiary pack dev etc etc). It is VERY rare for an individual to have influence or design power at a CPG on the packaging. In my past life I was involved in some of these but I had very little say, it was mostly just in meetings with stakeholders (creatives and designers) and decision makers (marketers and executives). Currently I'm super lucky as my company is a bit different and I manage the external design agency. This is where I brief and review all new designs and forms and then once they're approved execute. It's fun. \n\nFrom your post above it sounds like you need to be at a Packaging Design Firm or a Creative Firm of some kind that deals with many different brands. This will fulfill your needs and use your skill sets. \n\nPackaging developers at CPG barely get to influence the design it is more about execution. And if you're at a supplier you will be focused on whatever they make, specifically, paper, plastics etc. \n\nHope this helps.",

While there are many suppliers that can create basic cardboard boxes, their quality tends to be subpar, as the cardboard deteriorates easily even when thicker materials are specified. I've been observing packaging for other products and found a box for a Synology that perfectly matches what I need (see images below). \n\nI'm curious if there are specific terms or materials I should look for to ensure better quality cardboard. Additionally, I would appreciate recommendations for reliable suppliers to help me achieve this. Thank you in advance! \n\nHere are some examples of poor quality from our current supplier:",

        "content": "I'll try to help you. Please understand that there are nuances in every individual case that I cannot account for, so my word is not truth for every situation. If you have more questions after or if something doesn't make sense I can try to expand further, but I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible.\n\n1st. Difference between your box and Synology box - The box style is different. Yours is a 2 side rollover tray (FEFCO 0427), very similar to a pizza box style. The synology box looks to be something like a swing-in rollover style box with a locking tab (FEFCO 0470). These styles in my experience will result in very different finishes, as demonstrated by your pictures. \n\n2nd. Assuming these trays are made using the same flute (looks to be B flute perhaps), It is very possible that these boxes are run on different style machines. While both are unglued diecuts, there are two main style diecutters in our industry: Rotary and Flatbed. Rotary being cheaper (usually, but that might be mainly due to the throughput), higher volume, and usually lower quality vs a Flatbed (Although I have to add that rotary diecutters are the standard and usually do a fantastic job). Flatbed diecutters can offer more precise, consistent boxes. Flatbed diecutters are more rare, so your provider may not have one available. \n\n3rd. You mention the difference in the \"quality\" of the paper. This could be that the Synology box is a higher paper strength than yours. I find that heavier paper combinations do have more of a \"premium\" feel to them, and you will certainly have a stronger box as a result. \n\nAll of these things I have mentioned will result in higher costs... So the question you have to answer for you and your company is how much is a higher quality box worth to you? Would you be willing to double your packaging costs to get this higher quality?",

        "content": "You need to dig deeper into corrugated board specifications. Box makers usually have a few different options for the same flute and thickness, since every corrugated board layer can be made of different paper liners with different qualities. \n\nFor the best quality you need to ditch anything that is recycled and move to more cellulose based options (kraft). If you are worried about the trees ask for FSC or PEFC certified material. Read about ECT (edge crush test). Higher ECT number means better quality board. Also be prepared for a price shift, because higher ECT + KRAFT usually means higher material price. \n\nThe horror sample in your photo clearly shows a few things:\n\n1. Flute direction of the box is wrong. You want your fluting to be perpendicular to double crease lines, which helps to achieve nicer double fold. Your box looks like a modification of FEFCO 0471 standard model to make it look more like a FEFCO 0427, but they kept a flute direction of FEFCO 0427.\n2. Board may be too weak for your prodoct and it tears and crashes from weight.\n3. Board may be ok, but there might be some problems with structural design, which makes your box fold bad. Your product may be badly fitted into insert and movement may tear something. But these things are too hard to confirm from photos only.",

Since my product is quite fragile, I realize I need more than just a box, but I'm unsure whether to use cardboard inserts, soft packing foam, or molded styrofoam. There are different protection levels and costs involved, so testing seems necessary. Do you have any advice on how to choose void filling materials or secure features on my own? Is it worthwhile for small businesses to pay for ISTA testing during packaging design? Have any of you successfully conducted your own tests to validate your packaging? I have the skills to create cardboard templates for the inserts and think it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to conduct drop and vibration tests to find out what works.",

What info is included on the outside of the box? What's included inside on any user manual type pamphlet? Having reference material is always helpful. Depending on what you expect the quantity to be on your first production run, I'd look into a rapid print type of place that does custom boxes. Somewhere like [this place ](https://designersfoldingbox.com/corrugated-boxes/) or [this one](https://www.printingplusink.com/). Both of these are places I've worked with, but they're east coast.

If we add a rigid board covered in foil, we get the benefit of a thicker material that also works as a thermal insulator to block any residual heat from the tray forming process. The rigid board gives enough pack stiffness that you require only very thin plastic, so the amount of heat/time required can be reduced accordingly.\n\nThese compound benefits mean the risks from thin, fragile product and temperature exposure are largely mitigated.\n\nThere could be other benefits, however I think you\u2019d need inherent knowledge of the applicable to have such information",

Makes me want to take a pack of water and put it on a compression table.\n\nBottles of beer in boxes, that takes the glass as a structural component. Think of the comparison of what will hurt more - if someone wearing a stiletto heal steps on you or an elephant. So basically because there are 12 structures within the pack. The weight from above is stretched across all the bottles and a little bit saved from the box they\u2019re in. \n\nCans are metal.

I run a boutique wedding photography studio and need a more cost-effective way to package our photo albums for shipping. We send out about 150 albums a year in three sizes: 12x12, 11x14, and 12x16 inches. Currently, I use a 14x14x4 inch black box for all, which matches our brand, but the constant use of bubble wrap is cumbersome, and finding different-sized boxes is becoming expensive. I'm considering customizable polyethylene foam inserts for improved efficiency but haven't found any suppliers. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

My gut says maybe consider some paper options since the damage risk during shipping probably isn\u2019t too high, but you want a nice unboxing experience. \n\nI\u2019d look into shredded crinkle paper, and if your require a bit more protection maybe look into wrapping your albums with honeycomb paper as well. I\u2019d pack some like this and see how much movement you get- if product is shifting a lot you may need regular Kraft paper instead of shredded crinkle. If so, the rolls are cheap and just crumple by hand. \n\nThese should be cheaper and less time consuming than foam, which I\u2019d assume you\u2019d be cutting to size by hand for each album.",

However, Transport Packaging, especially regarding Life Cycle Extension, Reverse Logistics, and Sustainability, isn't a popular topic, and I'm struggling to find sufficient literature and online resources. I'm reaching out to see if any experts in this field can help. I appreciate any suggestions for relevant literature, videos, research papers, websites, or personal insights you might have.

Within Artios you can filter by blank size, material, customer name etc. As long as the information is properly logged into the files (which it isn\u2019t always) everything is incredibly easy to find. Of course, this is limited to paperboard and corrugated based packaging and limited to the designers that have ArtiosCAD. \n\nAt my previous job they were all built into the production art files. For anything 3D (jars, bottles, thermoformed parts etc.) we\u2019re created in Solidworks or Fusion 360, exported as drawings and dropped onto production art files. All files were organized by customer and the first part of the SKU number indicated what material family the packaging was made of. There was no quick way to find anything. It was mostly built around somebody remembering that we designed \u201cx\u201dpackaging for \u201cx\u201d customer. \n\nFor both companies all files are given unique SKU numbers with revision number and letter at the end. They\u2019re then referenced in the company\u2019s database program under a unique job number which links to all the other information like quotes, job status, customer name etc. The spec information is logged in the database, but not linked to the design/spec files themselves. Which as a you can imagine can cause issues. \n\nI would imagine this^ is how most packaging companies operate but I\u2019ve only worked at 2 places so far. \n\nA few months ago I interviewed at a place that uses a software called Spec Right to manage their specs and track projects. I don\u2019t know much more than that and if it has any integration with design files that would prevent the issues mentioned above.",

I initially proposed a fixed monthly rate based on the area used (length x width), which included dock space. They regularly utilize 10,000 SQ FT of dock space for inspection and serial number verification before storage. I appreciate any assistance.",

    "content": "We are a small company that serves around 30 will call customers daily. Each pickup can range from a small box of business cards to 50-60 boxes weighing 45 lbs each. This process is physically demanding for the person moving boxes from waist-height tables or carts to ground/dock level for customer pickup. We propose building carts at a height that aligns with gravity roller conveyors, which would slope down to dock height and include a 90-degree turn for easy access. Currently, we have about 8 to 12 feet for the decline, with some flexibility. Despite researching, I haven't found gravity roller conveyors that reach the floor. While I could consult a materials handling company, this project is small and might lead to unnecessary upselling. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated. Thank you to everyone who considers this.",

    "content": "Hello, we are looking to select new handheld barcode scanners. Our previous choice of \"small\" models did not work out well. We've been using the Tera mini wireless scanners, but we've had about two break within a week and one lose connection after a few seconds. While some workers preferred to stick with the old models due to resistance to change, I believe the two that broke were genuine accidents, as users pressed the buttons too hard and they caved in. This indicates a lack of durability. Although we advised users to handle them gently, one break involved a temporary worker. Given that we anticipate increased use during the holiday season, I want to find a more robust model. Currently, we primarily use EAN-13 and ITF-14 barcodes. Additionally, I learned just recently that the range of these scanners from the main device (an Android) is an issue. Many users keep the Android near their cart and only take the scanner when needed, sometimes leaving it at the beginning of the lane. We need a scanner that can maintain a connection at 5 to 6 meters, as the ones we have disconnect after about 1 to 2 meters.",

They should make some accommodations for you or find another task you are better suited for.\nEdit: two other points to consider.  They can not make a statement that other women could do it, that is sexist and illegal. Now it\u2019s a new job and you don\u2019t want to stir the pot, but you should not be a victim of the workplace.  OSHA exists for a reason and it is entirely confidential who called in a complaint.  If you feel you are treated unfairly, or that you are subjected to unsafe conditions call OSHA.  Were there any pre-qualifications for the job for weight to carry, etc?",

        "content": "Hey there, I'm also a fairly petite 21 year old female who's been working in a warehouse for close to three years. I was actually the first female ever to work in the warehouse at this company, so there were alot of mixed reactions from people. Some were very willing to help me, and others thought I had no place there. When I started, I wasn't very muscular and I'd say I could only comfortably lift at most maybe 45-55 pounds without struggling. I used to have to ask for help alot. Once you work there for a while longer, you'll start to know who you can go to for help and who you should avoid. When I started, I immediately got a sense as to who I could go to, so I always stuck with those same few people when it came to needing help. After being here for so many years, doing a couple different jobs around the shop, I've gained quite a bit more muscle and now I can comfortably lift 75-80 pounds. It's hard work, but the more frequently and the longer you keep it up, the easier it will become. In the meantime, maintain a well balanced diet, drink plenty of water throughout your day, and do not hurt yourself by attempting to lift something that you know you can't by yourself. Ask for help when you need it, and if someone gives you a hard time about it, go to your supervisor or if necessary, H.R. Good luck!!",

If they knew full well the job included heavy lifting they should have made that abundantly clear to you beforehand. They can't compare you're work rate to any other staff member nor can they technically (at least here in the UK) call you out on work rates unless you're clearly being lazy or disruptive, and explicitly missing KPI's or clauses in your contract about work rates. \n\nWarehouse employers can't always cater to every staff member but they should make an effort to accommodate people... At least that's how it should be, warehousing jobs are a mixed bag. I've worked in places with amazing support where everyone assisted heavy lifting anything over 10kg, and also other places where you were moving 25kg boxes alone all day. Even the beefcake staff were suffering after a day of that.\n\nNow I'm in a position to employ staff I always advertise 'must be able to be on your feet for long periods and be reasonably fit as heavy lifting is required throughout the day'. In the interview I'll go into more detail which is usually enough for everyone to work out if it's the right job for them. I'll be honest and say maybe this employer isn't suited to you, however there are plenty of others that probably are.",

How much of what comes in has to be raised to be stored and is that daily and how many pallets is that?  You want to get an idea of how much is moving and where it will go.  This will help identify if you need powered equipment, how much and what type. It\u2019s a good idea to have redundancy as mentioned already.  Manual pallet jacks are a cheap way to ensure product keeps moving on the floor.  If you go vertical you need a backup plan to retrieve pallets up high.  Do you have a neighbor with a forklift you can borrow last minute, or do you need your own backup onsite in your warehouse?  Also, what are you storing and will your racking be stronger enough to support it?  There are cheap pallet lifters, but weight capacity and lift height are both low.",

Ask them what they think may have caused this error. If their logic brings them to something like a pick or receive error, ask how they would prevent that from happening in the future.

        "content": "Bit of a disclaimer but I've never worked at O'Reilly, so here's my more general advice assuming you have a performance tracking system. \n\nIf the DC is worth its salt it'll have a decent training program. I'd say pace yourself. If it's similar to my job you won't have to work at 100% until six weeks after training. Even then, management usually doesn't care so long as they see consistent growth. I'm a slow learner, it takes me forever to master any job function. I just try to push myself to work better and faster each day.\n\nDon't work hard at the start if the system does track your performance, you want time to learn your job properly and then slowly try to get faster. I followed my trainer's advice which was to start at 55% and then each week increase by 5-10 percent.\n\nIf/when you are struggling to maintain 100%, I reccomend you just push yourself to keep moving. You should only ease up once you know that you can reach 125% working hard, and 100% is laughably slow for you.\n\nAlso ask the senior workers for advice. They'll have good tips and know the ins and outs of their jobs. They may not necessarily be friendly (especially while on the clock) but the good ones will give pointers that'll boost your efficiency.\n\nTake a supervisor's advice with a grain of salt. If they're ordering you to do something do it, but sometimes they can be really off mark with their suggestions.\n\nIn the beginning the more senior workers may seem very imposing and unfriendly. As long as you make an effort to keep out of their way, they'll learn to appreciate you. I still do that for others even though I can easily pull 120, because it generates a nice quid pro quo between Coworkers.\n\nThis is very general advice because I have no clue what job function you are doing, but I loosely based it on pallet assembly. Your trainor's advice and guidance trumps anything on the internet. Best of luck!",

I\u2019ve tried using gloves, but they slow me down, so I use carpenter gloves with half-fingers for my thumb, index, and middle fingers. Does anyone have suggestions? I've already asked in r/athletic training. Taping my cuticles doesn\u2019t hold up for long, and while liquid bandage helps, it takes too long to dry since I get paid per item. Is there a type of \"finger condom\" or thimble designed for people who frequently reach into boxes? Thanks!",

However, the finger scanner has been problematic; workers find it cumbersome because they often need to reach into boxes, making it difficult to handle items. We\u2019re sticking with the wearable terminal since it fits the workflow, but we\u2019ve switched to a different model. Unfortunately, that model also has issues. I'm looking for recommendations on portable scanners that won\u2019t hinder workers who are handling many items.",

When I moved to produce, it was more of a temperature issue, touching frequently wet 1-4 degree product all the time saps away your body heat. A nifty trick as well when handling too much wet produce is to swap out my gloves, now my hands are back to being dry and warm. Now that I'm in the freezer, gloves (of course) are still important, but I only wear two pairs of fabric and use other clothing to keep warm.\n\nAs for enforcement, I'd say there should be none, just the option for workers to use them (ie company provided). I use gloves in all my warehouse tasks, from operating reach truck to assembling pallets, to loading and recieving. I find gloves to mostly be the catch all to repetitive injuries on hands. Box cuts are impossible, and knife cuts are reduced (I've accidentally slashed my hands without getting cut). Anecdotally, when I see others that injure their hands, they usually aren't wearing gloves. That trend, however, may be because accident prone workers don't think/care to wear gloves.\n\nAt first using gloves is more difficult to assemble (pallets) with, but within a week I learned how to easily pick up boxes with little grip (tilt and grab).",

For general protection in the warehouse they\u2019re not naturally regarded as a requirement as much as you may see eye protection being a requirement more often than not in warehouses due to looking up and general dust that might come off of long stored items.  Box cuts are particularly nasty, think paper cut x10.  Knife cuts are absolutely horrible and can result in loss of digits or permanent impairment.

Currently, we batch pick small parcel orders daily to optimize our warehouse picking path. While we can match labels to orders, we can't identify which label corresponds to each box within an order. Right now, we\u2019re manually matching label dimensions to items and writing the Item ID on each label for correct box placement. There must be a more efficient way to handle this, but I'm stuck.

    "content": "# Managing a Successful Warehouse Operation\n\nWhat key areas should managers focus on? Here\u2019s a summary along with links to detailed articles. While setting up a warehouse may seem straightforward, the complexity arises from the many tasks involved. Often, warehouse managers encounter issues because they overlook some critical aspects of operation.\n\n## Begin with an Effective Warehouse Layout\nIn a slow-moving warehouse, layout may not seem crucial, but as activity increases, inefficiencies become apparent, such as bottlenecks, cross-traffic, lost items, and inadequate quality control. An efficient warehouse layout creates a smooth flow of goods, minimizing unnecessary movement. Additionally, ensure proper equipment for storage, handling, packing, and inventory control.\n\n## Prioritize Warehouse Safety\nSafety incidents can severely disrupt operations, and the warehousing industry has a higher fatal injury rate than the national average. Key hazards include dock accidents, forklift mishaps, conveyor injuries, improper material storage, and manual lifting issues. Prioritize safety training and incorporate safety measures into your warehouse setup from the start.\n\n## Provide Comprehensive Employee Training\nTraining is vital for both safety and efficiency. Ensure your staff is well-versed in packing methods, forklift operation, and quality control processes. Effective training enhances speed, reduces errors, and promotes a safer work environment.\n\n## Explore Small-Scale Automation\nWarehouse automation often involves specialized machines for repetitive tasks rather than complete robotic systems. Examples include automatic box builders and computerized quality control. Such automation can enhance productivity without replacing human workers.\n\n## Optimize Employee Management\nHiring the right number of workers and efficiently managing their schedules is essential. Monitor performance to identify improvements, such as differences in task completion times and workflow efficiency.\n\n## Efficient Inventory Management\nBalancing pick velocity with available space is key to effective inventory management. Adhere to core rules for inventory control to avoid issues associated with overstocking or understocking.\n\n## Continuously Seek Efficiency Improvements\nLook for bottlenecks and inefficiencies in operations. Implement solutions such as barcode systems, staging areas, and improved signage to enhance productivity.\n\n## Prepare for Successful Warehouse Management\nUnderstanding these seven areas can make warehouse management more manageable. Explore our resources on warehouse operations to enhance your efficiency and profitability.",

One of the things you can get at a low cost are cardboard and plastic  re-enforcers (Or Corner Boards). Layered they're actually pretty strong,..   \n[Laminations](https://www.laminationsonline.com/) actually makes shipping crates out of them that hold a LOT of weight. ( I think they have a video where they park a car on them)\n  \nCorner boards at the vertical edges permit layers of stacks depending on the weight of the product, the weight of the pallet, and the means to secure the corner boards; that is, whether or not they are secured by sheet wrap or strapping. All these factors and the number of pallets stacked determine the size and strength of the corner board. They also prevent normal damage and strapping damage as well.",

We need to cut metal rail to these sizes, but in Sage, we track our inventory by total lengths of rail in stock. For example, if we have five 1-meter lengths, we record it as 5 \"units.\" Since products often require custom sizes, we end up with shorter lengths that appear as stock but aren't usable for larger products, as we can\u2019t combine several shorter lengths. For instance, if we purchase 6m of rail and use 5m, we show 1m left in stock. The issue arises when we have multiple 1m lengths, leading us to mistakenly believe we have more total usable length than we actually do. This has happened repeatedly with various products, and we haven't found a solution other than scrapping old rail and manually adjusting our inventory. Does anyone have suggestions on how to manage stock for this type of product?",

So when you cut down a 5m and are left with 1m you would adjust the 5m piece off and adjust a 1m piece on.\n\nIt would depend on if you have the staff or stock controller to keep up with the adjustments.

If you chose to acknowledge and look for them. \n\nTech is only a tool, you still need to operate that tool effectively.  For example anyone can type out posts but not everyone can write a novel or an article that is enjoyable to read. Having a computer does not make you a writer. But it is a good tool for writing. There are levels of effectiveness. A good process aims for an acceptable balance of investment vs value. Be it labor, training or equipment. \n\nIt's all about the process. What I've had to deal with is poor training and lack of standards. For example we have a %100 pack scan on orders being shipped out. Great. But the people doing the scanning are not well trained. Management operates under the fallacy that  have the scanner makes everyone %100 perfect. I had an order for a $300 item and a $10 item that was missing the $300 item. Upon investigation, I found that the packer had dumped both items out, scanned the $10 item and put the $300 item in the carton to be shipped. Then scanned the $10 item again and sent it back as a mis-pick. Calling for the $300 item to finish the order.  The only reason this time was caught is because that was the only one we had left. They lost track of where they were because they didn't have a good process in place to make use of the technology. \n\nAnother example, had an order that needed an item. Oddly we should have 4 two for the order and 2 left. Upon inspection, the picker had picked a case of 4 as 1 unit. The packer, not knowing any better had scanned the barcode on the case and incorrectly thought it was 1 unit of sale. Neither person was properly trained to know what they were looking at. But the scanner accepted what it was told. 1 scan = 1 unit.",

    "content": "I recently started as a Quality Engineer at a gasket manufacturing company. The operators primarily rely on paper records, leading to poor visibility regarding who was working and the materials used when customer issues arise. We have around 100 presses, both automated and manual, that process rubber compounds and sometimes include metal inserts for added structure. After production, gaskets may undergo additional curing and quality checks. Our suppliers, which may be external companies or our own branches, provide the rubber and inserts, each batch having a unique barcode. However, tracking who produced what and when is challenging. Operators create vague \"P-charts\" that only cover 2-hour intervals. For instance, while an operator can make 500 gaskets in that time, they only note the box numbers of the inserts used, not where the finished products go afterward. This situation is quite problematic. I\u2019m considering automating the process by implementing barcode scanners at each station for rubber reels and insert boxes, allowing operators to scan materials as they use them and finished products as they create them. I assume each station would need a computer and possibly a label printer, which we currently lack. What would the estimated cost for such a project be, and how can I find someone to assist with this? Are there any relevant subreddits for information? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

Have a question about a gasket, scan its lot # and then check time/date/machine/line etc.. against whoever was working at that time.\n\nThere's a lot of out of the box systems that do this type of thing, but most of them want to add a billion other functionality points so it's hard to find one that small scale (ie affordable) and that just manages this type of thing.\n\nWe eventually wrote our own system to bolt on to our proprietary WMS/ERP system.\n\nAll product gets a receipt bar code when it comes in if it doesn't already have lot #'s from the mfg.\n\nUser gets a RFID card, we setup simple Wifi readers at every \"work\" location, and they scan in and scan out of jobs. That gives us which employee was working on what when. Then product lot #'s tell us when the product came in, when it was broken up (breaking up the lot creates new sub-lot #'s) and what process was being done to that lot at what time. \n\nQuery the two for a specific location/process/time and you get who was doing what, to what part of what lot, at what time.\n\nThis is really a simple process, the big hassle is setting up the workflow and getting people to adhere to scanning in/out of jobs. And of course depending on how many job/work locations and machines you have, setting up the hardware can be costly, but you can go standard barcodes and eliminate the RFID costs entirely. \n(Ie Bob gets a user barcode printed and stuck on a plastic card and \"Press Machine #1\" has a barcode on it, and when he starts working he has to scan his code and the machine code to \"Check in\" to the job, and then scan out when done. \n\nThis can be accomplished either by cheap mobile devices (tablets/phones with wifi or a $10 bar code reader attached to a cheap PC or thin client) or you can even do it on simple PC's and save it off daily to removable media if you don't have a wifi/netowork infrastructure.",

But here you can have facilities that will receive a container, de van it(safely unload it), then store or send the contents. De vanning here is about $250 a 20ft, with transport on top.

Previously I worked for a CCTV distributor and many of the cameras were in identical boxes and often differed in code by one digit so that led to picking issues.\n\nIt may work to have everything sectioned by product types for your business but I've found mixing products helps picking speed and avoids errors. E.g a location with one pump type, one sink type & one plug type will be easier to see what you are looking for than three different types of pump in similar packaging.\n\nMost ideal thing would be to take a few days to do an undisturbed full audit. Set up the locations during work hours and then close up for a day and count everything where it is. If you have your inventory exported to a spreadsheet you can log the locations and tally how many of each product is in each place and directly import the data back into your inventory system. If it does not allow products to be stored in multiple locations you can task staff to combine them afterwards. A spreadsheet will also keep a running tally on unders/overs which you can investigate.\n\nIf you need to do a rolling count, I'd say to set up the locations, clear a section on shelving and one by one count everything into the empty shelves and update as you do, then you can theoretically shift the stock along as you go. This can be tricky if you are having to pick the stock at the same time.\n\nApologies if that's a bit sweeping, it may work as you said and another post menetioned, to group certain things together by product-type but the above is my personal experiences.\n\nThe biggest challenge may be getting the staff on board especially if they aren't used to things changing. Counting is tedious but the payoff is important and satisfying. Maybe ask them first what the issues are, I find bribes of biscuits and snacks often helps!",

If you organize by numerical sequence, your overall understanding of locations will greatly improve over time. In terms of bringing on new product... Expect to be changing item locations because making room for the new product usually \"snakes\" theproduct further away from the beginning of the manufacturers designated isle. With sequencing you risk mispicks based on the idea that one part sitting next to the other could be one single digit different and can be confusing. The other problem with sequencing is that generally you will have two areas for each (main) manufacterer. Why? Because there are small parts and large parts. You absolutely want to seperate those in the case of limited space. My warehouse is also a retail enviroment in the front so it may be a little different for us.\n\nI manage a warehouse that sells toilets, pool chemicals aswell as anything related to plumbing and appliance parts.\n\nToilets are considered and handled more as bulk. Your toilets are sold in two pieces.. Tank and bowl right? It should be clearly defined and staged for picking in a way that is completely clear they match. \n\nPool chemicals are a beast in their own respect. At least at our company.  Part numbers are notoriously complex and not labeled very clearly. Do your best to create labels for pool chemicals that look similar to others. Same of the toilets our bromine,soda ash, sodium bicarb are treated as bulk as well. We keep one full pallet on the ground. It should be located somewhere accessible to pick as well as replenish. \n\n\nThere is a report you need to get your hands on. . . This is going to put your warehouse layout at optimal effectiveness and will help you to develop flow. \n\nObtain a report that indicates how often parts are sold. What you are looking for is parts that are constantly sold and reordered. I recommend having an area dedicated \"fast moving\" product and keeping that close to your processing area as to avoid unneccisary wasted travel time. \n\nWill update somemore but gonna run for now. I hope that helps.\n\n*I was offered a warehouse management position last year at 25 after ths previous manager spent the last six months of his 8 year career running the place into the ground. I'm happy to say it was one of the most challenging things I have overcome. Here we are a year later and I am still always doing whatever U can do makemy warehouse better.

Items are just being placed in cardboard boxes with labels, which is problematic for replenishment. Our high bay drivers often bring down pallets but tend to return them to incorrect locations, sometimes completely across the warehouse. I've suggested disabling the ability to manually enter locations, but many barcodes are malfunctioning, and we're working on fixing that. We're also struggling with discrepancies between physical inventory and what's recorded in our system. We use Oracle and Excel for our database, but years of neglect have left products disorganized. We're triggered for about 70 cycle counts daily, but we only have two counters. They conduct initial counts near the locations, and for items over $100, I try to track their history to find likely spots. Unfortunately, this approach only retrieves about 60% of the items, and we\u2019re falling behind due to staffing shortages. I'm seeking advice on these specific issues or general tips for inventory management. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to contributing to this community.",

This was all pen and paper so using the gun may work to help speed up this process. But for those that have barcode issues, you need to figure out how to get a printout of cycle counts. \n\nMy cycle count sheet indicated price of items so in order to speedily get through the most high value items, I skipped anything short of $80. \n\nOnce the numbers are recorder, if you must need a computer to change counts, you'll want to do it immediately after you do a single or small set of shelf. Why? Because inventory changes constantly  so it is important to have these numbers be a true reflection immediately.  \n\nFrom that point on, I did regular cycle counts and pinpointed particular locations that seemed to have to most issues. Evaluated the storage and location of the item and often moved it to make more sense. \n\nAs for people not putting stuff back where it belongs and just simply adding new locations, the team lead needs to step in and restrict the right to relocate parts to restricted access. Too many hands in the pot and obviously to much room for error. \n\nI hope that helped in some way!",

Inventory control can then figure out what is wrong with said pallets (bad barcodes, unsafe pallet, ect.) fix it and get a fork operator to clean up said pallets once the issue is resolved (as a new task for putaway).\n\nLike others mentioned use checkdidgits instead, that way location tags can last longer. Also how is efficiency tracked on replen? If it's similar to where I work travel time should be given for correct placement of pallets, and it should be cut for closer (ie. overridden) locations (but don't give time for further location overrides, thats how order fillers started travelling to the opposite side of the warehouse to print out their OLN where I'm at).\n\nTake my suggestions with a grain of salt, Im just a general labourer that likes his current warehouse system.",

It's worth learning, bit hopefully your company has a \"NetSuite Guru\" type figure to help get y'all initially set up and help with any integration issues you may have.

        "content": "First of all lets all agree on verbiage... many times I run into people who use SKU/ID/UPC/internal PN/Barcode interchangably.\nUPC= Universal Product Code, This is issued by the central GTIN authority and it's same number everywhere ( Best Buy, Wal-Mart, websiteIjustmadeupmomandpop.com. etc..)\n\nSKU's are Stock keeping units, and aren't universal. (usually unique in every step of the chain (mfg/3pl/retailer/etc..)\n\nSo for product A, that has UPC A1, Best Buy, Wal-Mark, and davesjunk.com all have different SKU's and then you have one as well. (I usually refer to SKU's as external, and part number as internal but that's just me)\n\nMost inventory ordering and control systems will let you setup an inventory cross reference where you can put in one/many of the numbers plus qualifiers. This helps when you're dealing with large qty's of parts as some mfg's will have the same sku for part A that another mfg has for part D. (we've run into mfg's that accidentally use the same SKU twice on their own different products) so it's always good to have a central tie in to your vetted part.\nThen all your lookups work the same way. (You lookup your internal part 123 and it shows you the 12/13/14 digit UPC's, and all your specific SKU's and who they belong to, or vica versa)\nThis really helps if you have inbound orders from multiple people as they can all use their own numbers and it all xrefs back to your part and is used/shipped/sold accordingly.\n\nDo your parts have any barcoded info on them for the UPC or SKU? Barcoding or RFID is IMHO essential for tracking all inbound, internal and oubound product actions. ( receipt/storage/move/shipping/selling/returns/repairs etc..)\n\nHow are you currently tracking those 20K parts? other than your \"misc\" PN\nIf someone needs a part do they have a desciption or anything to go off of or are they digging through piles?\n\nHow many mfg's are you dealing with? Sometimes you can get a dump from the mfg with inventory lines in a .csv and then you could just clean up, add xref's, margin etc..as needed\n\nSome Niche web products will do mass part lookups and imports off UPC's, but in most cases you just have to make \"Add the SKU/UPC/other/other\" part of your \"Add new part to the system\" checklist. And/or do a full physical with barcoding/labeling the parts and locations as part of that.\n\nMy suggestion without knowing all the details... Come up with a internal part number nomenclature and tie your part number to your mfg's sku's and UPC's. Barcode it if it's already in your physical, and add barcodes to anything coming in the doors. Get data files for imports where you can, then get an intern to do data entry for the rest.",

This is a good place for QA as each box/package usually has to be touched (either to palletize, or to do some kind of manifesting or packing into shipping boxes etc..) so the likelyhood of each unit getting correctly scanned in here is even better.\n\nTertiary check:  \n\nCapture ID/s and scan/pick efficiency. If you have one person constantly mis-picking through the month, time to have a talk with them. (Or a monthly $20 Amazon gift card for people with zero pick errors) etc..\n\nQuaternary check:  \n\nIf it's a huge issue with high value product, or you're seeing shrink,.. cams at packout to see who packed what.

Depending on your safety stock this can be a huge headache and cause on-shelf availability issues if you don't have labor in place to deal with reshelving. Remember we are not talking about cases, these are random single items. \n\nI would suggest you use scan to pick and scan to pack. It might not seem worth the trouble if you're small and you only have a few items at a time but if you get big, it'll be more costly and disruptive to re-train and alter workflow later.  \n\nFor DTC orders we use 100% scanning and for retail replenishment we use single scan verification. But people do often cheat by scanning the same item multiple times. With a rate system the cheating gets baked in at some point. \n\nIf an item cannot be located then we exception the order and investigate any possible inventory variance. \n\nWe use a homebrew WMS.",

Maybe you have a mix of both.\n\nCould also depend on how your facility is laid out. For example we only have 1 forward pick location for each item but some people use multiple locations. One or more of these could easily be overlooked when counting. Also do you operate more than one building? Inventory could be found in the wrong one.\n\nWe still do an annual inventory which can be a bear. We have pick bins, and whole case backstock. We do a quarterly cycle count of backstock.\n\nIn the forward pick bins we have issues with;\n\n* The shelf count differs from the record count. \n* Damaged items. (sometimes these are counted and then removed, causing a variance.) \n* Inactive items found that are not in our current inventory. \n* Unit of sale not counted correctly. (This is always confusing a simple way to think of it is if you have shoes sold by the pair and someone counts each pair as 2 shoes.)\n* Inaccurate counts (need to have a good audit process in place for this.) \n* Re-shelving that is still in process not included in the final count. \n* Damaged or missing bins that exist on paper which need to be located. \n* Bins that physically exist but are not do not on paper.\n* Items from mixed/mislabeled cases that we don't carry/sell. \n\nCycle count issues in backstock are tricky as well, we use a random allocation system based on license plates. This can cause a lot of issues when cycle counting. Most stem from either a bad read on the scanner or an error from the cycle counter. We use code 3of9 barcodes with an alpha/numeric, no check digit. The Motorola MC9000s we have are very prone to misreads on this symbology. I believe our printer font is the issue. Anyway, we also face issues caused by hand keying errors and procedural errors when counting.\n\nIssues we often see are; \n\n* Scanner misreading the barcodes. \n* Lost LPs (Most often a missed scan.) \n* Duplicate LPs. \n* LP is moved from one location to another, depending on how far it moved this could be an error or a duplicate. \n* LPs are found that the system thinks are in another warehouse. \n* Old LPs are reactivated. (Should already have been consumed.) \n* Cases are found that don't have an LP. (May be a missing label or not in the inventory.) \n* Cases are found with more than one LP.

You can even have the barcodes appear on your sales invoice to \"scan out\" against to triple check that the right product goes to the right order.\nCell phone + $35 bluetooth barcode scanner.\n\nIf they still have negative numbers, they're stealing, giving it away, or someone is looting your trucks.\n\nThe next, more expensive solution, (and the minimum I would suggest) would be to do the same thing behind a web app. (so it's a little more secure) and have that talk to a simple database behind the scenes for check in/out.\n\nPast that there's free online software (usually won't work the way you need it to and you'll have to shoehorn your process into their software or pay for mods) \n\nThen buying a full fledged WMS system.\n\nHope that helps.\n",

It should allow us to create labels for each received item, indicating ownership and destination, with a unique serial number displayed in both numeric and barcode formats. Each item's label will be scanned upon storage to maintain location accuracy. The database must enable us to assign items to specific dates and trailers, allowing the loading crew to scan items as they are loaded, ensuring only those for the designated trailer and date can be scanned to avoid errors. Customers should be able to check the receiving status of their items online to follow up with vendors if necessary. Our current pre-Windows database is outdated and unsupported, and with our rapid growth, we need a scalable solution. We are based in the USA. Thank you!",

My strengths include process improvement and organization, and I\u2019m interested in Lean Six Sigma, though I lack certifications. I\u2019m skilled at managing and motivating staff. In seven years, I aim to earn $70,000 to $80,000 annually. \n\nI\u2019m considering a few options to achieve this:\n- Getting a degree, which I find daunting and concerning due to potential debt.\n- Earning certifications to enhance my experience, though I\u2019m unsure which ones are valued by employers.\n- Exploring a career in logistics, which seems lucrative and aligns with my skills in load planning and customer service.\n\nI'm seeking advice from warehouse managers on Reddit who earn over $70,000. How did you reach that salary? Given my background, what path would you recommend? I\u2019m open to sharing more details. Thank you!",

        "content": "I would go to your boss and see ask what the development path within the organization would be.  Then on your next appraisal create a personal development program.  Express direct interest to your superiors on becoming lean/ six sigma certified.  What about internal auditing?   What can you get your current company to pay for?  What gaps do you see in your day to day that you feel could be addressed?  Do you have the skill set to address these gaps?  What skills would you need to develop to address these gaps?\n\nHave you specifically developed any SOP's?  You say your strengths are process streamlining and organization.  Can you back that up w/ MRP data from pre/ post implementation?  What performance indicators did you use to evaluate any implemented programs?  How did you determine that they were applicable? \n\nSo overall I have 3 pieces of advice:\n\n1. Determine where you want to go.  Warehouse management has many different levels to it and your request seems fairly broad.  It seams like you are focused on actual management of workers.  IMHO (key word humble - i'm in pretty much the same place as you) you should try to separate from the actual hands on management and move more to data analysis\n\n2. Get applicable certifications that will help you in your current role.  These will be paid for by your employer and allow you to gain experience in what they are teaching you to do.  Don't go to culinary school if you aren't going to be a chef. \n\n3. document what you have implemented.  it is a lot easier to support yourself if you can say \"i implemented project xyz on the following date.  we were using the following factors to measure performance and these were our actual results.  we determined that we did/ did not meet our goals for the following reasons\"\n\nSo i've moved into quality management and it sounds like you are managing warehouses that are much larger than what I ever have, so take my advise with a grain of salt.  \n\nGood Luck",

In which case you scan the item. A hip printer prints removable tags, you put the tags on the bag and put the parts in the bag. (Some places insist on one bag per part)\n\nWith the world getting 100% wired, \"Smart bins\" are starting to show up. \nSo you have a carry tote with a barcode. When you go to pick you scan the product code (from the box) then scan the tote, and your system knows that the product is in the tote. A little more programming, but you're not printing as many labels. This would be the case is all, or a large part of your inventory was small or bulk inventory with small pick qtys.\n\nWe use hip printers for those types of situations but they're very rare as we reliably scan very small bad codes. We have QR codes that are about 1/2 the size of a postage stamp for our smaller products with no hassle. We also have standard barcodes as small as 1x2 w/little or no issues. A higher resolution printer works wonders for the smaller codes. We use 200dpi for standard codes and 300dpi for especially dense or small codes. And remember you can print very short height bar codes and still get reliable scans if your product is only short on L or H.",

When properly implemented, all areas of the company should be using one centralized system where there are quality control measures that keep inventory in control. i.e formal receiving and intake processes, inventory management (adjustments, cycle counts, damages etc) and it should also be able to direct workers on where to go and what to do when items need picked for an order. \n\nFrom experience, I can recommend this solution.

The system can be accessed anywhere there's an internet connection. We offer plug-n-play integrations with many large online shopping cart platforms (Shopify, Magento, Big Commerce, WooCommerce, Ebay, Amazon and many more)  As far as quality controls around your physical inventory, we do offer a full set of warehouse management features such as PO/Receiving, Item/Inventory management as well Orders & Pick/Pack/Ship features. \n\nIn regards to tying in your POS system, I can't speak to your specific use case without knowing more but we do currently have a client who has integrated their POS with their Shopify store front. Whenever a POS order is captured it is sent from their POS to their Shopify, and then sent from Shopify to Infoplus via our integration. Once POS orders land within Infoplus they are automatically routed to \"Virtual POS\" Warehouse where the inventory is decremented. This allows our customer to track sales and inventory records on an automated or ad-hoc basis in real time. \n\nCheck out the website below and sign up for a demo to learn more. At the very least our sales team can point you in the right direction! \n\nhttp://www.infopluscommerce.com/",

Alt, if the pallet is just a bulk container for true raw bulk materials, then the UOM still counts, but you may also be working with catch weights to allow for better handling. \n\nIn your example, let's say that we have an SKU \\(DIRT1\\).   \n\nDIRT1 could be setup as following \n\n\\- L\\-UOM \\(Lowest\\-Unit of Measure\\) = 1 lbs\n\n\\- Inner Pack = N/A\n\n\\- Case Pack = N/A\n\n\\- Pallet = 1,000 lbs\n\nAnd in the warehouse, we setup DIRT1 to be pickable in two different UOM\n\n\\- Pickable via Pallet \n\n\\- Pickable via lbs \\(with Catch Weights\\) \n\nWe receive in DIRT1 by the pallet.   At receiving, each pallet of DIRT1 is assigned an LPN \\(just a unique barcode for that pallet\\) and then put away in the warehouse \\(to one of several different types of locations depending on demand, etc.\\). \n\nPallet in and Pallet out picking \\- those pallets are stored in \"Pallet\" locations, which will only allow PIPO. \n\nLbs out picking \\- that will take place from a pallet that is stored in a \"Standard\" or \"Down Forward\" location \\(which is replenished from a PIPO location as needed\\)\n\nWith the above \\- then we can have the system generate proper pick work for us based on what is needed. \n\nLet's say that you are running a process that is requesting 1,200 lbs of DIRT1.   The system will then direct you to grab 1 Pallet of DIRT1 from a pallet location, and then to grab 200 lbs of DIRT1 from a Down Forward Location. ",

B. Fill space. C. move things in and out of space for money.\nThe devil is in the details.\n\nThe biggest things to consider for 3pl/dist/warehousing:\n\nA. Rent (warehouses are a lot of sqft with $$/sqft charges that add up. heating/cooling/cleaning/security etc... etc..) Also look at the price variances for WH rent in your area for 5, 10, 15 years. Economy swings can instantly kill an operation that uses a lot of space. We had a large warehouse in Ireland a long time ago and rent prices changed a great profit center to a huge money pit nearly overnight. If that had been all our business, we would have had to fold up the business entirely. \"I can get space dirt cheap\" (that means everyone else can too, who can afford to hang on longer when the prices climb?)\n  \nB. Location (to provide the best value, you need to be in a place that has easy access preferably for truck/rail and even ship/air if possible. How many days are you out from your farthest shipping point? Will people want to wait that long? Can your afford to make up the difference?\n  \nC. Filling the space (which pays for that rent): The mindset of \"If you build it they will come\" has ruined a lot of WH startups. You need to have a good idea of how much space you can have committed day 1 to offsetting your costs, and have a plan for turnover/landing new clients ongoing 100% of the time. (We don't feel comfortable unless we're constantly discussing \"Is this the month we need to get another location/build more racks etc.. etc..)\n  \nD. Pick/Pack/Ship operations. To do it right you need automation/equipment/people (printers/forklifts/scanners/etc.. etc...) The equipment costs for a *small* warehouse can quickly go over $100K\n  \nE. Competition. There's really not a lot of \"secret sauce\" in this game. Everyone knows how to do the job, and the only real differentiation is quality of service and pricing. So,.. can you out perform the bigger guys who are established already and provide customers with better pricing all the while employing people who won't walk off with inventory?  I know of companies that will actually give away warehousing to get \"Other business\" from their customers. Their warehouses are 100% write off. That's a vast minority, but If you have a few of those guys in your area it's nearly impossible to compete.\n  \nF. Customers - We're really lucky to have some customers that have been with us for over 20+ years, but a large part of the people shopping for warehousing and 3pl services don't think about this as a partnership, it's viewed more as a necessary evil that they're outsourcing (like cleaning the toilets) and as such, they will have no problem dropping you in a heartbeat for someone who gives them a slightly better rate on storage/shipping/labels/etc.. etc..\n\nThe biggest thing to consider for \"Retail\" dist/3pl/WH:\nand by far the biggest \"pain point\" of dealing with retail,.. is the Retailers.\n\nMake no mistake, there's money to be made doing retail distribution, but it's not a slam dunk by any means. \"Managing Retailer Expectations\" is a full time job for a team of people at the smallest end of the scale.\n\nEDI files have to be generated 100% perfectly /Perfectly timed/ with all the right acknowledgements for changes/cancellations etc.. etc..  (or else you get charge backs, which YOU pay out of pocket)\nSpeaking of charge backs,.. Are you ready to have X-Mart charge you $50 *PER CARTON* on a pallet with 200 cartons on it b/c the pallet was cracked. Or b/c a label was crooked, or the pack slip/BOL had incorrect information.\n\nHow about a charge per carton for the *entire truckload* (Which could be thousands of cartons) if you have it arrive to late OR too early by too many hours?\n\nChargebacks are the 2nd largest profit center for some of the big retailers,.. \n(I REALLY wish I was making this up) Retailers can be an awesome win. If you're setup to service them correctly you can get some great throughput, but I'm not kidding when I say one mistake can destroy your ROI for years, or put you out of business nearly instantly.\n\nIf I was cash flush & looking to do a startup, there are much quicker/easier ways that incur less risk and provide a better profit on the list before you get to doing Dist & warehousing.",

As a startup, we\u2019re making good progress, but managing 15 Excel sheets has become overwhelming. We sell marijuana in Arizona, which requires us to deliver orders and collect payments either at delivery or later, depending on the terms. I\u2019d love your suggestions for order fulfillment software that fits within our budget of $100-$500 a month. Additionally, we are developing a CBD website using WooCommerce to sell products nationwide. Our requirements include: \n\n- Tracking returned products\n- Monitoring outstanding payments and terms\n- Updating order statuses (picked, delivered, payment collected, etc.)\n- Generating sales and inventory reports for purchasing predictions in Excel\n- Creating invoices\n- Being mobile-friendly\n- Ideally cloud-based\n- A barcode system for inventory management\n- Future integration with Shipworks or Shipstation for our CBD site, including printing tracking information and invoices.\n\nI know there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about features like order picking and pull systems, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Off the top of my head,.. \nAssuming everything is 100% in the legal department and you have all your licensing in order for your products...\nI think the #1 thing you should be looking for is something that has a lot of controls/flags for operations on the ERP/Financials side of the house. (Ie NEVER let a shipment with this destination address ship, never allow payments originating in this location to be processed etc... Red flag/notify if x, if y , if z. I think you'll have as many ERP/Financial requirements as WMS requirements, but nowadays there's a lot of overlap and combo systems that handle WMS and ERP functionality. Your budget is prime small/mid sized business cloud solution range, but any cloud solution may have regulatory issues dealing with your products, so you'll really have to vet all the related T&C with anyone cloud based. Of course you can do an \"on-premise\" install, then just host it on *your* cloud account as well if you have to. For shipping,.. take advantage of volume discounts, I'd suggest partnering with someone Like Connectship (have them do all the work to integrate the shipping logic and workflow as part of the sign up,.. you want to automate all that stuff based on your lowest cost to whatever the destination is)  As you mentioned,.. I can't over emphasize bar coding ALL products and move related processes and making sure product is \"received in\" and \"shipped/checked out\" systematically for all cases. Another *must have* Look for something that has \"Lot control\" (used in food and medical industries) in the event something happens w/your product, you need to be able to isolate the supplier, the breakdown, all the places it is and/or went to separate from the rest of your inventory (so you don't have to do a 100% recall/destroy/inspect) only the affected products are dealt with limits liability. And on the plus side,.. In the wine world those w/dates tie into expiration/freshness/vintage information for consumption so I'm sure the same applies here.",

I want to digitize this process to simplify operations and professionalize the system, especially as our founder ages and we aim for growth beyond our traditional methods. We have storage spread across various locations. \n\n1. Are there resources I can consult to learn how to develop an effective inventory system? How can I assess the reliability of someone I plan to hire for this task? I hope to keep costs down while we grow the business before making significant investments. \n2. Should the inventory system be integrated with an accounting system? What if the accounting software I have isn't compatible with an inventory system? \n3. I'm currently trying to manage everything manually as a temporary solution, but I'm struggling with certain items. For example, mechanical seals consist of two parts: a rotating and a stationary piece. I previously logged them as a complete set, but sometimes they need to be sold separately for specific sizes, which can be confusing when tracking. Thank you for your help! :) \n\nP.S. I have storage in different locations.",

        "content": "1. Cloud options are going to be cheaper/more reliable than getting someone to build something, and you'll have support, most will scale and worst case scenario make sure they have good export options so if you buy something bigger/better you can just export from system A. and import into system B.\n\n2. it's absolutely better to have this, just to save time/effort. Either you get them in one package (something like Camelot) or you have to do the work (or pay someone to do the work) to make them talk to each other. But most WMS's have some kind of hooks or exports to XML/.csv's so it will be doable either way.\n\n3. You want a system that knows how to deal with \"BOM's\" (Bill of materials) type products. (Ie you have a finished good part (Part 123 \"Black Leather office chair\") and then you have component parts (Part 123a \"Black left armrest\")  You can use these as assembly type orders (WMS will let you pre-format all the components that go into a finished good so you can check to see if you have all the component inventory to make 2, 20, 200 chairs and which parts you'd need to order additionally to make the most finished goods) Or you can just treat them like spare parts inventory. (ie you sell the chairs and people can order the arm rests if they want to, or only your authorized chair service center customers can order the arms etc.. etc..)\n\nSo you your case you'd have finished good \"123 Mechnical seal\" with the 2 components \"124 Rotating portion\" and \"125 Stationary Portion\". You can put an order into the system for \"Mecanical Seal\" and it will look at the BOM and automatically pull the two (1x124 1x125) parts from inventory. Then you may have the part \"133 Mechanical Seal #2\" that has the components \"124 Rotating portion\" and \"126 Extended Stationary Portion\". Ordering this part looks at the BOM and grabs the two (1x124, 1x126) components to make it up.\n\nMost WMS's allow you to add different locations. You'll want something with the ability to set Min/Max inventory with replenishment. (ie I want a minimum of qty 10000 of part \"123 Mechanical seal\" at location A at all times. I'm down to 9000 and I need to get 1000 from warehouse B to replenish. Or I need 1000 of component \"124 Rotating portion\" from warehouse B and qty 1000 of component \"125 Stationary Portion\" from warehouse C to replenish. \n\nAs I say to everyone. Barcode EVERYTHING (finished goods, components etc..) and Scan things into/out of processes. Receive everything into the system when it comes in, and check/ship everything out of the system when it goes out. Do that early on and you avoid a million headaches down the road.",

    "content": "My company uses Infor for inventory management, but it's inadequate for our warehouse needs, as it only provides total product counts without specifying quantities in each bin. We face issues like inaccurate inventory counts, leading to wasted time. Currently, we update our inventory manually with pen and paper before entering it into a large Excel file, which is error-prone. The Excel file only indicates potential bin locations for items, causing our warehouse team to spend excessive time checking stock and updating the file.\n\nWith over 2,000 rack spaces and limited room, we often have to consolidate items. I've seen other warehouses effectively using barcodes on products, pallets, and rack locations for tracking. I envision a system where every received item is scanned and placed on a pallet, with the pallet's barcode linking to a cloud-based WMS. This would allow me to track item locations efficiently, even for pallets temporarily stored on the ground, which should have their own barcodes.\n\nI'm seeking a modern solution that integrates with our Infor system to ensure accurate inventory updates for our sales team. I'm considering warehouse management systems that can sync with Infor, as well as exploring ERPs, but I'm uncertain about the best options and their costs. Any guidance would be appreciated! Thank you for your help!",

The WMS's purpose is to track inventory, direct movement, and in many cases, exchange data to other systems. \n\nLearn more about the product you already have so you can talk more effectively with WMS vendors. For example, if your current product is running on a MySQL database, ask vendors if their WMS can read from and write to the database.",

(scan barcode into stock and location, pick barcode out of stock and location) helps make things mostly idiot proof.",

I have about 10 years of warehousing experience in various roles like picking, packing, and shipping. Currently, my job is a mix of management and entry-level tasks, where I can't hire or fire, have no purchasing power, and report to the quality manager for warehouse layout. However, I'm responsible for daily operations, create my own schedule, and oversee temporary employees without direct hiring authority. \n\nThe new position would give me full responsibility for four full-time staff, including hiring, firing, ordering, ensuring we meet metrics, and conducting performance reviews. While I\u2019m not guaranteed the job, things look promising, and I believe I can handle it due to my intelligence, sense of responsibility, and attention to detail. This role represents a significant increase in responsibility, with my direct supervisor located at corporate HQ. \n\nDoes anyone have advice or insights on what to watch out for or lessons learned from first-time management experiences? I want to prepare thoroughly to give my best effort. The work involves straightforward tasks like picking, packing, receiving, and inventory management. Thank you in advance!",

        "content": "First, let me say CONGRATULATIONS on earning a great promotion in an excellent career field!\n\nSome things to consider:\n****\n\n1. The #1 responsibility of a Manager is to deliver results through other people.  How they do it is the difference between a good and bad Manager.\n\n1. The best Managers understand that employees are valuable people with skills, not people with valuable skills.\n\n1. The #1 skill a Manager should learn is how to hire the correct person for the job.  The #2 skill a Manager should learn is how to properly motivate that person.  The #3 skill a Manager should learn is how to let a person go, with grace and dignity, quickly, who is not working out.\n\n1. Know your P&L metrics and what things, while not quite metrics, really impress your boss (going out of your way for a customer, always on time with reports, time clock is always accurate, etc.).\n\n1. Take a look at the Performance Appraisal for your job, so you know what you will be specifically graded on.\n\n1. Cycle count your inventory with ruthless consistency and research variances outside of acceptable deviation.  Know what happened before your boss asks.\n\n1. Keep your equipment routinely maintained and your safety records (from weekly meetings to ratings) immaculate.\n\n1. Keep every piece of inventory accounted for in a bin location in your computer system.\n\n1.  In a warehouse with a few employees, it is important to lead from the floor, not the office, unless otherwise stated.  You should lead by example, be the first to pitch in, and heap praise on those who go above and beyond.\n\n1. Grab hold of free podcasts, like \"Manager Tools\", to learn a **system** of management.  Management skill **isn't** something you either have or don't have, **management skill is learned** - and there are some easy-to-learn ways to get it right.\n\n1. Most employees want a boss, not a buddy, no matter what they say to your face.  You can't be an effective leader if you are afraid to upset your employees with longer hours or the occasional weekend work.  If you were buddies before, be prepared for some distance as you transition into being the boss.\n\n1. Managers earn their money when it's hard. If you don't know what that means yet, you'll understand it over time.\n\n1. Finally, it doesn't matter what the company culture is at the Corporate office.  If you are managing a remote warehouse, you can choose and foster your own culture.  Pick one that leaves your team tired but happy and fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\n****\n\nsource: My own opinions, from my experience managing 300+ warehouse employees at 9 locations in positions ranging from Team Lead, Supervisor, Manager, Regional Manager and Division Manager.  I am currently the Chief Operating Officer.",

    "content": "I work with a business that sells bowling equipment and accessories by liquidating closeouts, overstocks, and open box items from across the USA. They bring these items to their warehouse, quickly select the high-value products for their physical store, and auction off the rest. The store has its own warehouse and inventory system, so items are essentially considered sold once shipped. Managing this like a typical warehouse seems too time-consuming, but I\u2019m unsure how to track inventory without following standard procedures. We label received products with removable labels indicating their storage location, then put them away. At auction, we scan the buyer's pickup sheet for a directed pick. Since all items received will be gone in 14 days\u2014either sent to the store, auctioned, destroyed, or donated\u2014I wonder if there's a quicker way to manage this, especially since it's all \"no returns.\" Finance receives a record of items in versus those sold, destroyed, or moved, so there's no need to retain that data either. I'm looking for workflow changes that would better fit this business model.",

Directed putaway means your system \"knows where the product is\" at pick time, then when you pick you know where to go...\n  \n\nThe only thing I can think of that might speed up your process,.. if your auctions aren't live (like you win your auction today pick up tomorrow, 2 days later etc..) then you could pick each \"winner's items\" into a lot, then have those lots staged so you wouldn't have to wait till they give you the sheet, then pick through your inventory. You'd just have it all ready to go (by bidder name/number etc..) if they don't pick up put it in a quarantine area and start charging them storage fees if you don't already.",

Now, we want to bring logistics and fulfillment in-house. We sell lightweight jewelry, averaging around 10 grams each, and process about 150 orders daily, which makes third-party fulfillment costly. We're looking to manage our own warehousing and order fulfillment, ensuring smooth integration with our simple Shopify store. I'm seeking recommendations for warehouse setup and software solutions for inventory and fulfillment, ideally a single tool. I've explored options like Shipstation and SKUlabs. Any advice would be appreciated, especially regarding warehouse setup, as I have experience in big box retail and need a scaled-down version of those systems. Thank you!",

Are you doing it, are you going to have full time staff, will they be all trades or will you have dedicated receiving etc.. etc... \n\nJust trying to get a better idea of the lay of the land before I suggest options.\n\nObviously I'm going off limited info, but here's my first thoughts:\n\nWith Jewelry, your items will be high theft targets, so WH security is something to think about.\n\nAs far as fulfillment software goes, budget is the key factor. I have a lot of smaller clients who use [Delivrd](http://www.delivrd.com/). It's free to use up to 25 items, so no reason not to check it out.\n\nNext up the ladder would be fishbowl, then if you're serious something like Camelot.",

        "content": "Hey hey! \n\nI'm kind of with Hatelabs on this one in that it seems unfeasible that you'll actually be better off insourcing. Here's why:\n\n*  10 grams is light as heck. You're well under 1 lb. With most fulfillment centers, you're in the sweet spot, since they will almost always get excellent rates on packages under a pound. Furthermore, and more importantly, they will likely get better rates than you'll get. \n\n*  150 orders per day is outstanding volume for a small eCommerce store. Full disclosure, I work for a fulfillment center, and we definitely offer reductions on pick/pack fees with volume that high. Does your 3PL do that? \n\n*  You require very little storage space per SKU. \n\nAnyway, I'll tell you that I think you'll find Shipstation to be a good source. I recommend them, personally, for an inventory/fulfillment solution. \n\nThe key, however, is that picking, packing, negotiating rates, etc. is pretty expensive at best and time consuming at worst. This is time you can spend increasing your edge in the marketplace! \n\nSo if you decide to explore other options for fulfillment, check us out over at [ShipMonk](https://www.shipmonk.com). And if not, I definitely recommend Shipstation. :) Good luck out there!",

However, I've noticed existing systems (like this one) and am grappling with the common challenge in tech development: creating something impressive that may not be needed. How viable is my idea? Would you consider investing in robots for moving boxes, or is it impractical given existing solutions? My robot is designed with wheels, arms, and navigation capabilities, essentially functioning as a self-driving forklift. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts\u2014please add me on Skype for a 15-minute chat at hellosir1337.

Our sales have increased year after year, and it looks to be only growing. \n\nThe other problem is that these are typically multi-million $/\u20ac/\u00a3 systems.

I want a software solution that displays current inventory levels and allows my colleagues to scan barcodes for items taken, updating the inventory in real time. It should be server-based, accessible by 10-20 iPads and a few PCs. Does such software exist? I would appreciate any recommendations! We are a small business unit, and all equipment is stored in a compact warehouse where we work. Most available software seems tailored for large online retailers with extensive inventories, so a solution designed for small businesses would be ideal. Thank you! Adam",

    "content": "I would appreciate any suggestions for subreddits to cross-post this to! I'm looking to enhance warehouse efficiency with an idea I believe has been previously developed and likely shared online. Here\u2019s a summary of my concept: \n\n1. I have over 12,000 part numbers.\n2. We have both overstock and stock bins across 14 aisles, each containing a few items.\n3. I want a quicker way to count the bins and verify that the overstock boxes have the correct quantity marked by the manufacturer.\n4. Since one part number might come in two box types (one for stock and one for overstock), I need a program that allows me to select a part number and view different entries for weights of both stock bins and overstock boxes.\n5. I\u2019d also like to use a universal packing bin on a scale, which I can easily fill while checking counts. For smaller items, I can throw in a handful and see the quantity displayed.\n\nIn practice, I\u2019d have a laptop and USB scale with me. For example, if I want 15 units of part #123a, I would weigh the item and the packing bin if needed, then input the part number into the program, add the parts, and it would display the count, accounting for any weight variance. This would significantly speed up inventory counts by calculating quantities based on the combined weights of the items and bins.\n\nThe challenge is finding existing resources online, as most results focus on programming terms or scales for other purposes. If anyone knows of similar projects or resources, I\u2019d greatly appreciate your guidance! \n\nEDIT: The heaviest boxes will weigh 50-60 lbs, while the lightest items will be just a few ounces.",

Billions have been invested in finding the optimal ways to manage inventory/location/movement and generally barcodes (or if you're flush with cash RFID) are the way to go... (examples below are oversimple)\n\nBin location = 1number (usually consisting of row/bin) A1\nCase count = 1 part number - WCC20CB = 20countWidgetcolorblue\n\"Each\" quantity part = another part number. WIC1CB=1Widgetcolorblue\n\nIf case is unopened or visually inspected as full, scan bin, scan case barcode.\n\nIf opened, scan bin, then scan item barcodes, or count and scan item barcode and enter quantity.\n\nSo after 1 quick set of scans, you'd have you'd have Bin has X cases and X eaches of parts 1,2,3,4,5,etc.. and in many cases you don't even need to take anything out of the bins.\n\nYou can do all this with a wifi data collection terminal and dump it to the app of your choosing (heck I've seen small outfits use a Ipaq with an IR scanner $50 and MS Access).\n\nI think you'll find more programs want to work with bin/part/case/pallet where those things have weight as a unit descriptor than trying to go backwards from weight. \n\nBut if you're going to have someone \"touch\" the units anyway... scanning barcodes is going to be quicker/easier, than lugging a scale around, putting products on it, entering the product ID, putting a box on the scale, waiting for the scale weight to register, committing the weight, then putting the box back etc....   \nScan gun, scan product, put a cycle count flag in the DB and now that bin has been \"counted\" as of today's date. Never need to count it again unless something is picked/placed in it, and if you have good tracking on the bin in/out, you can go years and not count.\n\nThere's also the case where someone puts a wrong product in a box  b/c they're similar size/shape (most common mistake) so you could have products with the same/different weights in a box, again I just see this as more prone to error and the more difficult row to hoe.\n\nMy guys can usually cycle count a bin with mixed parts, with open boxes (ensuring there's no cross contamination) in a couple of minutes per bin on a good day. \n\nWith my Closed cases, it's multiple bins per minute w/out touching a box.\n",

How intensive are their inventory requirements? How many pick and pack orders do they expect? How many truckloads of inventory should you expect to receive? What about to ship? Do they prefer to be billed on actual work done or to contract it at a fixed rate depending on their needs? What sort of special requirements do they have? Are the orders time-sensitive? Will they need to have access to software for real-time inventory? \n\nYou'd need to factor all of this together to determine what your costs will be then determine what the value of your services will be and attach that as your margin on your services. The more you can learn about their needs the more you can find ways to add value with the services that you provide. ",

Each shipment is either on a pallet or shipped loose, with costs based on the number of items and their weight. I\u2019m focusing on reducing the number of pallets used and maximizing their space. However, we often ship heavy pallets, and stacking large boxes can damage the boxes underneath, leading us to use more pallets than necessary, which is inefficient and costly. I need advice on how to distribute the weight better so that we can stack boxes without adding another pallet on top, as our supply of pallets is limited. Any tips or recommended tools/supplies would be greatly appreciated. I\u2019ve been in this role for less than a year and am eager to improve. Thank you!",

Obviously this is dependent on the necessity or lack there of with expediency. Generally speaking when it comes to LTL, it does vary between carriers, as close to 3200lbs as you can get on one pallet will give you the best value. ",

(My nephew operates a crane system for those) is amazingly different from someone who's doing distribution for big box retailers. (Which is what I mainly do)\n    \n  \n\nEven within groups of people who deal with the same types of products there's a lot of variables to consider.\n\nOf course there's also a lot of things that are common across all types of warehouses.\n  \nHeat mapping is an easy example.\nIn my case I have 300Ksqft of warehouse space with 45ft ceilings. Some of my customers are distribution customers who have lots of products that go into big box retailers which means they have a VERY high turnover. So their products get put away in \"hot zones\" that are very close to the pick/pack/ship operations. I have some B2C customers that do several orders a year, they're in a \"cold\" zone which is much farther away and/or higher up.\n  \n\nThat all ties into the workflow automation which can be done in many different ways depending on a ton of factors.\n  \n\nMy warehouse has 45ft ceilings and we stack pallets high, but amazon's robotic picking systems are low profile so it's in their best interest to buy a space that has bigger footprint with lower ceilings. (and conversely if you were designing layout/workflow to fit a pre-existing space plan, you might pick different options for how to do the work) \n  \n\nWhat if you find a great location/price on a building that has high ceilings but you don't need to stack things high,..  you can put in mezzanines and double your footprint, but now you have to deal with the fact that there's only so many points where horizontal travel are possible...\n  \n\n\"Warehouseing\" seems pretty simple at first blush, but in today's world almost no one (outside storage units) really does \"just warehousing\" there's almost always some kind of order/pick/pack/ship operation involved as well. And then places like ours are doing more and more full service (from package/product design, through the product lifecycle, all the way to handling returns and customer support) and all those things require different hooks and processes to revolve around them as well, process, physical, infrastructure, data and support.",

Which is a pain, but 1 month of review VS 6 months is considerably less so.\n\nAlso if you're going to install a cam system, add the extra cameras to cover your receiving dock,.. the number of times we've been saved on people trying to blame us for damaged shipments, more than paid for the cams.

        "content": "A basic concept that is used in one of accounts I work Inventory for is measuring cubic inches.  You need to calculate the cube of your locations/staging area, this will give you a rough idea of much you could fit at capacity in a perfect world, then the cube of a single case of your product/sku(Divided by QTY of each case to get a cube per piece).\n\nThen you just need to find the rate of growth of your onhand inventory, you can get this by seeing how much you inbound each month vs how much you outbound.  For Example\n\n\n\nMonths | QTY Inbound | QTY Outbound | Variance\n---|---|---|----\nJan | 47 | 24 | 23\nFeb | 52 | 15 | 37\nMarch | 35 | 32 | 3\nMay | 0 | 12 | -12\nJune | 78 | 28 | 50\nJuly | 56 | 14 | 42\n\nBy taking the variance of each month and getting an average we can see that over these 6 months you actually gained 23.83 total onhand on average each month.  You can take this data as a decent indicator of how much you should expect your inventory to grow/shrink in the future.  Now more math :D.  Take the average rate of change we just found multiply by the cube of qty 1 of your sku, then take your total cube of available divided by this number and that will give you a rough idea of how many months till you reach capacity at your average inbound/outbound rate.\n\nThis of course assumes your sku is always the same size.  This can work for as many skus as you want it just gets that much more complicated the more skus you calculate for at the same time.  Also you will want to get data for as far back as you can to get a better average and you may need to make alterations based on any issues that might have arisen that could have interrupted inbound/outbound rates that would fall outside of normal circumstances.  Oh and you can replace inches with feet just as well just depends on the size of your product.\n\n\nIf you have any questions I'll be glad to elaborate I'm usually pretty bad at explaining anything to anyone XD\n\n-Stu_Brah-",

I follow up persistently and have a backup list of vendors to ensure timely quotes.\n4. **Best Fit:** Besides cost, I evaluate quotes based on service quality, delivery times, and vendor reliability. Sometimes, a slightly higher quote is worth it for better service.\n5. **Tools/Strategies:** I use online platforms and software that aggregate quotes and provide comparison tools. Building strong relationships with reliable vendors also helps streamline the process.\n\nHope this helps, and looking forward to seeing the solution you develop!  \nBest of luck for your Business!",

I'm from Vietnam and will be starting a three-year Supply Chain Operations Management program with a co-op at George Brown College in Canada next September, which will lead to an Advanced Diploma. While I understand that practical experience is often more valuable than a degree, I have some concerns about my future career: \n\n1. Many people aim for a bachelor's degree, but I've opted for an advanced diploma in Business Administration - Supply Chain Management. I'm curious if this diploma will help me enter the industry, especially since I've heard many pursue an MBA to advance their careers.\n\n2. If I want to become a buyer or work in procurement, what entry-level jobs should I consider (like Inventory or Logistics Coordinator)? I'm currently applying for inventory positions at places like Walmart and supermarkets, but it's challenging to find opportunities. What part-time jobs could I pursue to gain relevant experience?\n\n3. The Canadian government is proposing a new policy that would limit the three-year Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) to international students in high-demand fields (STEM, Healthcare, Trades), making it harder for a Business student like me to remain in Canada post-graduation. Many countries require a bachelor's degree as a minimum for job applications, which worries me about my future prospects. Is not having a degree going to be a barrier for me?",

My roles have included carrier representative and sales account manager, and I'm currently an account manager in Managed Transportation, where I assist a client's logistics team as a contractor. I earn about $115k, but I'm seeking to reduce stress by exploring new areas within supply chain management. I've been applying for positions in buyer, procurement, and analyst roles, but I'm not getting the expected responses, and rejection emails are increasing. I\u2019m open to a pay cut to around $80k-$90k for an entry or mid-level position while working my way up, aiming for a Supply Chain Manager role in a few years and potentially a director position in about ten years.

    "content": "Here are the links to the original posts: , , . You can find the tool here: ImportYeti scans 150 million public shipping records, making it 1,000 times easier to find quality suppliers than using Alibaba alone. You can answer questions such as: Who produces Goodyear\u2019s tires? Answer: Sumitomo. Who is the leading supplier of olives from Greece? Answer: Deas S A. Who are the main companies importing/exporting under HS Code 3102.21 (Ammonium Sulfate)? The latest updates include enhancements to our Smart Bookmarks feature, allowing you to save company and supplier pages into custom groups and receive updates for new shipments. We also made several changes to our Location Pages, including improved company and supplier filters, a nearby states feature, and updated graphs for labor costs, top countries, and destination ports. Additional features include an annual importing frequency graph, shipment breakdown by bill type, FCL vs LCL shipments graph, and better site navigation. I welcome all feedback, whether positive or negative, as I aim to create features that users truly appreciate. Thanks to everyone who contributed their thoughts on the site redesign.

Had no internship in my field; started working a forklift job the year before graduation and some months after that.\u00a0\n\nEventually managed to land an interview with a good company and a couple years later was making 6 figs. Another guy at my work started same time as me in his mid 30s and he\u2019s finally making 6 gigs near 40. So don\u2019t worry about how old you are, the ideal timeline is whatever works for you.\u00a0\n\nI agree with what the other guy said too. Go get an hourly warehouse job to work when you\u2019re not in class. If it\u2019s a bigger company like UPS or FedEx they\u2019ll definitely value the degree and may put you on a manager track once you\u2019re done with school. Otherwise, you still have some income while you search. Not to mention if the company is big enough you could ask for a transfer to the location you\u2019d like to job search in.\u00a0\n\nAnd don\u2019t give a thought to chicks right now, dating after you have a career is as different to college dating as college is to highschool dating. You\u2019ll meet other people just focus on walking the stage and what comes after right now.\u00a0",

With enough self-will, the numbers are in your favor.\n\nThose issues seem to be largely material - so quick advise:\n\n1. Ask for help - loved that you posted here\n2. Ask your friends/people for help - no friends? Seek out a local meetup that aligns with your passion.\n3. Put yourself out there - in person and in social\n4. Expand your mind to recognize those coming in contact with your life - if there\u2019s something intriguing ask and ask if they\u2019re willing to help you \n5. List yourself on all hiring platforms  - take whatever decent job you can, make friends with the right superiors, and apply yourself + do good honest work\n6. Leverage AI / employment companies to create bomb resumes and help get you out there\n7. Dating apps - sign up for all but ideally friends of friends. \n8. Network actively and ask great questions \n9. Meditate, read, and know all of this will pass\n10. You\u2019re young, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the beauty and challenge of life. \n12. Seek professional help too if you need it. Therapy helps all people and there are wellness organizations that can possibly help you free or at minimum cost. There should be tons of wellness non profits (I\u2019ve not used them but assuming this is the case, until you can pay for a service or therapist on your own.)\n\nNavigate it as best you can, talk to people, be open about your struggles, find your communities, do good work, help people out even if it doesn\u2019t benefit you, and that lucky break will happen.\n\nOpportunities to advance and get to where you want to be in life is a function of manufactured luck - maximize your chances for getting lucky and eventually you will. It won\u2019t be easy to start but eventually it will become habit and the right mindset will help you overcome. \n\nWishing you clear waters and smooth sailing, change your course if you need, but ride it out my friend. Best of luck",

Consider certifications in relevant areas.\n\nApply smart: focus on entry-level positions and attend career fairs. Use your college's career services for help with your resume and job search.\n\nHighlight skills: emphasize relevant coursework, projects, and transferable skills like communication and problem-solving.\n\nStay positive and keep applying.

The reason is that this would be appealing criteria, you can do it on the side, and it can be applied nearly universally at a job (probably much needed anyway).

    "content": "In today's fast-paced work environments, the discussion around traditional management methods versus visual management systems is intensifying. Traditional approaches often depend on detailed reports, meetings, and written communication for information sharing and progress tracking. While effective in some situations, these methods can hinder timely decision-making and responsiveness. In contrast, visual management systems transform team operations by utilizing visual elements like charts, graphs, and color-coded displays, making information easily accessible and understandable. This promotes faster decision-making and increases workforce engagement. Key Differences: Communication: Traditional methods depend on written reports and meetings, whereas visual systems use visual cues for quick understanding. Accessibility: Visual management systems facilitate easier data access, saving time on document searches. Decision-making: Visual cues allow for quicker decisions by presenting information clearly. Engagement: Visual systems boost employee engagement by making goals and progress visible to all. Adaptability: Traditional methods may be less agile in responding to changes compared to visual management systems.",

It allows companies to systematically identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential risks. Key components include: 1. Visual mapping of the supply chain 2. Risk identification, such as political instability and environmental issues 3. Improved anticipation and management of disruptions. The process generally involves: 1. Thorough data collection on supply chain elements 2. Risk prioritization based on likelihood and impact 3. Consideration of unpredictable events like natural disasters 4. Regular audits and inspections. This method can also enhance sustainability and operational efficiency. To keep risk maps effective, companies use tools like ESG dashboards, supplier audits, and employee feedback programs. In a time of increasing supply chain complexity and global challenges, Supply Chain Risk Mapping is essential for maintaining competitiveness and resilience, helping to mitigate disruptions while fostering continuous improvement across the supply network.

Some industries like the Railroads, seaport longshoremen and trucking do\u2026 if you\u2019re looking at that.  But most companies after they thank you for your service won\u2019t care much.\n\nAlso be cognizant of where you want to live and work.  Major hubs like Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles Seattle, even Jacksonville have a ton of Logistics positions.  If you\u2019re looking to go to Rapid City SD or   Columbia SC\u2026 places like that not so much.\n\nLast of you\u2019re thinking Trucking or Railroads or Merchant Marines or similar\u2026 kids your wife and kids and college aspirations good bye, you\u2019ll never see them.\n\n(Source: Recently retired Army Logistics\u202620+ years)",

    "content": "Hello everyone. I have a question that might seem trivial, but I'd prefer to ask than assume. During my final year of high school, I didn't take pure mathematics, accounting, or economics; I only studied business studies and mathematical literacy. At that time, I wasn't sure about my career path, and my subject choices lacked focus. Now, I've developed a strong interest in logistics and achieved a bachelor's pass in my matric, though my marks weren't outstanding and I didn't earn any distinctions. I've researched various logistics paths in terms of education and careers, and I want to know if I need extensive knowledge of accounting and pure math to pursue logistics, or if it varies by specific careers. My goal is to work in warehouse management, starting as a general warehouse worker (like a packer or driver) while I study. I'm also working on my Excel and basic bookkeeping skills through online courses, as I'm interested in office administration and know these skills will help me. I haven't been in school for a while because I've been a full-time mom and I'm currently homeschooling my children, but I plan to enroll them in public school so I can work and study. I'm feeling quite intimidated about returning to school. Do you have any advice for someone without a background in accounting and pure math who wants to pursue logistics? Should I reconsider my plans? Thank you!",

I'm 18 and have only experienced a small part of Logistics through my warehouse job, where I check in trailers and ensure operations receive everything correctly, fulfilling purchase orders (P.O.s) and investigating any discrepancies. I also use Vessel Finder and Carrier Reports to estimate the workload for our warehouse of about 200-300 people, allowing us to prepare in advance and adjust hours as needed. Additionally, I plan and organize paperwork for incoming containers, ensuring product allocation is in order. Our main goal is to ensure all products are received correctly and in the condition claimed by the vendor, while also paying the P.O.s.\n\nWhat should I pursue next? Before registering for classes, my uncle suggested that Supply Chain is essentially an advanced version of Logistics, offering broader opportunities and more growth potential. How significant is the difference between SCM and Logistics? Would a career in Logistics limit me to warehouse positions? If so, how can I advance in Logistics? Also, how does Supply Chain differ from Logistics, and what does \"ops\" refer to? I've heard it can be a high-stress role.",

After graduating in 2020, I began working as a warehouse administrator at DB Schenker, where I managed customer interactions and tracked orders using SAP. Unfortunately, the work environment was toxic, and employees, including management, were often looked down upon. My experience was challenging, as I had to commute two hours each way six days a week without transportation or allowances. \n\nI eventually left that job and sought opportunities in logistics and supply chain. Then, I received a call from DHL via LinkedIn, interviewed with the regional manager, and got hired. DHL is a much better experience; they provide allowances, a salary increase, and transportation. However, I still prefer to work in logistics or supply chain rather than warehousing. I feel stuck in my current position with no clear path for advancement, and I'm unsure whether to continue in warehousing as a stepping stone toward a logistics role at headquarters after completing my master's. I would appreciate any advice or support, as I'm feeling lost. Thank you.",

I hold a bachelor's degree in organizational management from Ashford University but have no certifications. Living 45 minutes from Philadelphia and an hour from Baltimore, I have experience as an assistant project manager in a commissary warehouse, logistics specialist, warehouse technician, and contract negotiator, all of which paid under $45,000, often for just a year. Managing employees is quite stressful for me, and I have a strong interest in supply chain management. A professional resume writer helped me create my resume, and this year I've applied to 170 jobs, receiving seven phone screenings for positions around $90,000, but all ended in rejection or silence. I sensed these roles might be too advanced for me, as they inquired about my experience as a buyer, which I lack; my role focuses on ensuring timely production supplies. As a Christian, I value honesty and wouldn\u2019t want to misrepresent myself to secure a job. I'm contemplating pursuing CPIM, CSCP, or an SC MicroMasters from MIT. I've been in my current position for 1 year and 8 months and am thinking about applying for more materials management or buyer roles while wanting to stay close to my family. My wife, who is foreign, is also struggling to find high-paying work. What would you suggest I do?",

    "content": "I'm currently interning at a mid-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on their Warehouse Management System (WMS). While I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS could improve our disorganized warehouse, where items frequently go missing and finding anything is challenging. We're still using outdated methods without an effective system. We have two warehouse employees and storage for around 1,900 pallets. My proposal includes implementing barcode labeling and scanners to enhance inventory control and organizing the warehouse by SKU. I believe a WMS could help with managing SKUs and barcoding.\n\nTo optimize the warehouse for the future, we need better tracking of goods and procurement, as many old items linger due to a lack of oversight. I aim to improve insights on inventory locations for more efficient order picking, streamline the receiving process, and automate operations. Currently, only two suppliers provide compatible barcodes, complicating inventory accuracy. \n\nThere are challenges with WMS integration, particularly concerning our Exact Globe + ERP system, which may cause issues. Implementation costs are estimated between thousands to over 10,000 euros, raising the question of whether it's necessary. One vendor suggested using CVC files and an FTP server, but I lack expertise in that area. A standalone system might be a better option, but WMS is crucial for inventory accuracy and doesn\u2019t align with our current processes. \n\nWe manually write off used goods during manufacturing, leading to many discrepancies since the warehouse is open for anyone to take what they need. While we don't need all WMS features, we seek better control over our inventory and procurement data. I'm uncertain about the quality of supplier barcodes and whether this can be resolved with scanners and printers, as we only have one scanner that works with two suppliers.\n\nI want a WMS solution but am concerned about potential issues with our ERP and existing processes, which could significantly increase costs. With fewer than 100 employees, our budget is limited, and one vendor quoted over 40,000 euros plus 2,000 euros annually, which seems excessive. I would appreciate guidance, as navigating this situation feels overwhelming.",

Let me explain why ...\n\nA WMS is essentially a software solution designed to help companies manage their warehouse operations more efficiently. It provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, tracks the movement of goods, and optimizes warehouse processes.\n\nIn your case, where stuff seems to go missing frequently and it's challenging to locate items, a WMS can be a game-changer. With a WMS in place, you'll have a centralized system that keeps track of every item in your warehouse. This means no more searching high and low for missing products!\n\nOne potential WMS solution that might\u00a0be worth looking into is Zenventory. Zenventory is an intuitive, easy-to-use, out-of-the-box (and affordable) WMS software that offers a range of features to streamline warehouse operations. It can help automate tasks like receiving, put-away, picking, and shipping, saving employees precious time and minimizing errors. (The software also supports barcode scanning and barcode creation.) \n\nFull disclaimer: I do work at Zenventory. So, I am a little biased. But there are many other WMS options out there - a quick Google search will show you just that. :)\u00a0  \n  \nGood luck finding the best solution for you and your business!\u00a0\u00a0",

The company aims for a target of 700KGs/LDM, but while some lines meet this goal, others consistently fall short due to various potential issues, such as unreliable customer data, loading and unloading times, and inefficient planning. \n\nMy research objective is to identify the factors leading to these low LDM rates and propose improvement strategies. I plan to employ a mixed-methods approach for data collection, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods.\n\n**Quantitative Data Collection:** I will observe the loading processes for selected export lines over a month, recording key metrics like loading times, planned versus actual LDM, and utilization rates using standardized forms.\n\n**Qualitative Data Collection:** After each week of observations, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with warehouse staff and coordinators involved in the export lines to gather insights on inconsistencies, challenges affecting LDM efficiency, and suggestions for improvements.\n\n**Data Analysis:** I aim to integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings to understand how different factors interact and influence LDM.\n\nI'm seeking feedback on my research methodology\u2014are there any weaknesses or areas for improvement? Additionally, are there any theories or frameworks on logistics optimization or warehouse efficiency, aside from the Theory of Constraints, that you would recommend? Thank you!",

    "content": "Hello everyone. I feel a bit overwhelmed, but I've secured a well-paying position as a supply chain analyst at a manufacturing company, which is a significant step up from my previous role as a data entry clerk. While I appreciate my current job, the manual processes are exhausting. The company, though growing quickly, relies heavily on Excel for everything, which is challenging for me to manage. \n\nMy daily routine involves processing purchase orders (POs) sent via EDI, which are then faxed to me\u2014yes, faxed! I organize these POs by customer and ship date, logging each one into an Excel sheet manually. After booking each PO with the customer, I have to log it again on another sheet for carrier pickup. I\u2019ve created some automated templates in Excel to help streamline this, but it's still very time-consuming.\n\nI also monitor line efficiency and inventory using Excel, generating reports for head office that summarize our plant\u2019s performance. If we run out of materials, that falls on me, but I often struggle to keep track of inventory due to my workload. I dictate daily production based on customer orders and need to anticipate demand, but the current manual tracking system is insufficient.\n\nMy personal life has been quite hectic, and I worry that dedicating time to improving our processes will delay order fulfillment. Fortunately, another person has been hired to assist with manual entry, allowing me to focus on inventory and efficiency. I\u2019m eager to tackle these challenges but unsure where to begin.",

    "content": "I attend a well-known, top-ranked supply chain management university in the northeastern U.S., but it's a satellite campus. I've observed that most students in supply chain programs who secure prestigious internships and high-level jobs after graduation are primarily white. At a recent event by Heinz Kraft, a leading consumer packaged goods company, all employees were from elite schools like Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, with no representation from lesser-known state universities. This raises an important question: Do graduates from less recognized state schools have a real opportunity to land high-paying internships, which could lead to job offers starting between $80,000 and $100,000, potentially with companies covering their master\u2019s or MBA expenses, and eventually earning $250,000 to $350,000 annually? I'm curious if this is a feasible path for students from less prestigious state schools.",

Then search some of those international suppliers as the Shipper to see which other American distributors they are supplying to. This is a great way to find wholesale distributors in the US and to find overseas manufacturers for private label. \n\nThey only give you a few free searches per day. When those free searches are exhausted, you can simply change the location in your VPN to get another few free searches.

They save me a little time, but not significantly. The interface is appealing, though it seems to have limited route options. There's a vast schedule network, including inland barge and rail options, and the map is impressive. However, the quote system is ineffective. It's beneficial to have price estimates and capacity information.",

The goal is to locate a shipping partner that excels in handling, timeliness, and cost. I'm seeking your expertise on a few points: 1. What key factors should I consider when assessing air freight services? 2. Are there any tools or platforms to compare freight companies? 3. How can I verify a company's reliability and efficiency? 4. What should I look for when choosing a freight forwarder? 5. Any specific advice for international shipping in this industry? I appreciate any insights or resources you can share to help me navigate this process. Thank you!",

    "content": "Hello Reddit! I hope you're all doing well. I'm new to posting here, so please be patient with me. I've been contemplating a career change or advancement. To give you some background, I started in warehousing after earning my bachelor's in Supply Chain Management (Operations emphasis) but soon realized it wasn't the right fit. I worked there for three years while pursuing a master's in Integrated Supply Chain Management during the COVID pandemic, which hindered my plans to transition to the corporate side of my company. I eventually left for a role at a company supplying medical products to hospitals, starting as an associate supply planner at about $60,000. I loved this job, and after eight months, I completed my master's degree, intending to leverage it for a raise. I worked hard for a promotion and, upon my one-year anniversary, accepted a new position as a supply planner. Unfortunately, I could only negotiate my salary to $68,000, which felt disappointing, but I later received a raise to $75,000 after a market review. I've excelled in my role and have been told I'm ready for the next step, but senior positions in planning are scarce. I recently interviewed for a supply chain management role but lost out to a senior buyer with over nine years of experience. \n\nMy question for more experienced individuals is: how can I break into a six-figure salary? While I don't want to seem solely focused on money, it is crucial for me as I need to support my wife, who was laid off while pregnant, and our 10-month-old daughter. I'm exploring opportunities in tech and would appreciate insights on other options. I have extensive knowledge of AS400 and SAP, so any related opportunities would be great. If you have advice and would like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. Thank you!",

Unfortunately, most companies won't let you continue to grow several steps up, and even when they do the pay increase is typically between 7% and 12% per promotion. It's dumb, but it's one of those corporate BS unwritten rules.\n\nYou will be able to grow salary leaps and bounds moving around. 3 years at a company is perfectly acceptable nowadays and you won't look like a job hopper with that as an average.\n\nMy biggest additional advice would be to consider jobs in other cities/states. Your child is young enough that you won't be uprooting them from familiar school/friends, and your wife isn't currently employed. Opening your target job market so multiple states also multiplies your possibility for large salary increases. With your years experience, you should be able to negotiate a relocation bonus which would cover the cost of the move. Depending on the area, distance, and CoL, I would aim for about $12k.",

Usually companies will be less strict about entry level education and GPA when you\u2019ve worked for them for awhile, For example working at a Walmart store and then getting promoted/transferring to their corporate office in bentonville, or working at a target store and then promoted/transferring to the Minneapolis corporate office once you graduate.

Right now, I use separate Excel spreadsheets for each supplier (see attached image). These contain shipping details from the supplier or freight forwarder, and I can track container numbers and vessels. However, I struggle to determine which items from the purchase orders are in each container, especially when dealing with lengthy orders spread across multiple containers. While I can handle the spreadsheets, they consume a lot of my time, and the process feels unnecessarily tedious. Additionally, the shared document feature in Excel is ineffective, leading my colleagues to maintain their own spreadsheets. Communication via email is also cumbersome; I've set up subfolders to organize messages, but I've still missed crucial information. We frequently handle international shipments with long lead times, and I once forgot to send a purchase order, which upset several people. I'm relatively new to supply chain management, and my boss, who taught me the current processes, is open to trying a new system. I\u2019d appreciate any suggestions on improving my workflow or recommendations for systems that could help address these challenges.",

We're also working on a new product search feature that aims to identify the best manufacturer for specific products (e.g., I want to find the top manufacturer for poker chips; PM me for an invite to test it). Additionally, we've introduced several new features such as Xeneta\u2019s data integration, Alibaba supplier data integration, ports/lanes data, container code pages, an annual importing frequency graph, a potential website feature, and improvements on total sea shipments over time. I welcome any feedback, whether positive or negative, no matter how small or extreme. I aim to create features that people truly appreciate. Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the site redesign. Please feel free to PM me or comment below anytime.",

I'm seeking insights from those in small and medium-sized businesses, especially where advanced technology for automating KPI calculations and reporting may be lacking or underutilized. For smaller companies, how much time do you typically spend on manual KPI calculations and reporting? What tools or methods do you use? Additionally, if you're involved in creating reports or presentations for leadership, how long does it take you to draft an email or create a PowerPoint? For those in medium-sized companies with established tech stacks, how effectively can you analyze your KPIs, dashboards, or reports using your current technology? Does your tech stack significantly decrease the time and effort required compared to manual processes? I'm interested in understanding the workload of KPI management in smaller companies and whether larger companies benefit from efficiencies in automating these tasks. I look forward to your thoughts.",

After a brief transit, I indicated I would file a claim when signing the Bill of Lading and later presented evidence of the damage to the senior manager, who advised me to assess the extent of the damage before contacting him again. The damage occurred because a local facility manager neglected the shipment for over two months, exposing it to poor conditions that caused mold and permanent harm. \n\nI'm trying to approach the senior manager appropriately, as this is a small company and my claim's outcome depends on his willingness to proceed. However, he has been trying to dismiss my concerns and claims there's no liability, despite having received detailed evidence of the damage. I plan to present evidence of the delays caused by the facility manager\u2019s negligence and assert their liability for improper storage. I want to negotiate an amicable settlement for the items that are irreparably damaged, particularly some valuable collector's books. \n\nI'm looking for advice on how to be assertive yet polite, maintain a good relationship with the manager, and indicate that I\u2019m willing to escalate the issue if necessary. I have several months left to resolve this since the claim limit is one year, and while I prefer not to hire a lawyer, I\u2019m prepared to be persistent in dealing with this manager.",

    "content": "I was recently accepted into the MBA evening program at Arizona State University for Fall 2024. I'm 30 years old (turning 31 when I start) and currently work in inventory control for a chemical company's supply chain, earning $64,000 in Arizona. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in business communication and have been pursuing a career in supply chain, which I find fascinating. I previously worked in transportation management and as a planner for a government warehouse. Should I pursue my MBA? I've heard my new company offers $5,000 per year for tuition reimbursement if I achieve at least a B in my classes, but I haven\u2019t confirmed this yet. I plan to stay long-term at my current job and evaluate my situation in a couple of years. I've had to change jobs twice recently, and my regular business degree lacks a supply chain focus. Would an MBA with a concentration in supply chain be worthwhile? The program costs $60,000, and the company might reimburse $10,000 to $15,000 over 2-3 years. However, extending to three years just for an additional $5,000 seems excessive. I've heard having an MBA could lead to better long-term earnings. After reimbursement, I'd be looking at $29,000 in undergrad debt plus an additional $45,000 to $50,000 for the MBA, depending on the company's support. I intend to apply for scholarships, but my GPA is 2.54, so I'm uncertain about my chances. Being from Mexico, I've faced challenges that contributed to my GPA, but I have strong aspirations to improve Arizona, which motivates my desire for an MBA. I feel I have a compelling story and purpose, but I seek professional advice before taking on more debt for school, as I want to ensure it will be beneficial in the end. What are your thoughts? Thank you!",

I'm interested in learning about the experiences of buyers and demand planners in the food, pharma, and building materials sectors regarding their planning and purchasing processes, and whether this tool could be beneficial. Having grown up in the import/export food industry, I'm aware that purchasing often relies on intuition\u2014such as competitor pricing, supply chain issues, and environmental factors affecting supply. Would a tool that highlights macroeconomic trends affecting product demand be useful to you? For example: - Demand for Product A is projected to drop by 20% next week due to an upcoming tariff in XYZ countries. - Demand for Product B is expected to rise by 4% next month due to increased grain commodity prices. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Previously, I ran a cloud kitchen startup in India for two years, but had to close it due to the second COVID-19 lockdown. I have a postgraduate diploma in supply chain management and business analytics from Canada, and I completed an MBA in marketing and human resource management from 2017 to 2019 while running my startup. With only two years left on my work permit, I'm considering getting an AZ truck driving license in Ontario. Although the $10,000 investment and one-month training seem daunting, I see it as a way into the transportation sector, hoping to transition into logistics later. However, I'm concerned because my true passion is in procurement, and I'm afraid I might end up stuck in a driving role due to the high demand for truck drivers. I would appreciate any advice on this situation, and I'm also interested in the challenges of moving from logistics to procurement. Thank you.",

My university doesn't offer an undergraduate program in this area, and I'm only a year away from graduation. Are there alternative ways to enter the supply chain management field without a related degree? Do employers primarily seek business degrees for hiring? I'm also considering micromasters programs and certifications as potential routes to start applying for jobs in supply chain management. How do these credentials stack up against an undergraduate focus in supply chain or business? Thank you!",

        "content": "Sorry if I'm late to the party. You can still get your foot in the door at entry level without a degree in SCM. I studied Spanish literature for my undergrad. What would be extremely helpful is:\n\n1. The tools required for analytics. This includes being VERY adept at Excel (sadly this is still used at nearly every company) - to the level of VBA/macros. Learn SQL. Learn some sort of visualization software (PowerBI and/or Tableau). If you are into programming, learn Python and/or (or Octave if you are good at calculus and linear algebra). All of these will give you an edge on getting a job over someone with a SC degree but without valuable skills.\n\n2. Consider getting either a Master's Certificate in supply chain management or becoming APICS certified. I don't know what the APICS cost is, but Master's Certificate can go from about $4k to $12k in the US, depending on the school. This will show that you have some solid conceptual understanding of supply chains despite a poli sci (or spanish lit) undergrad.\n\n3. Consider working at a distribution center as a coordinator. Pay isn't always great and it will be a good amount of assistant-type work, but you will be exposed to the environment and able to learn the ropes. This is valuable experience to get you into a more admin role in other pillars of supply chain.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Now, I'm considering whether to use this time to pursue a master's degree in supply chain management. Before making that decision, I want to understand the field better. Are there common risks I should be aware of and prepare for if I work in this role? Can tasks become overly stressful depending on the company? Are there online resources I should explore to develop an analytical mindset for this field? I enjoy traveling\u2014does this job require frequent travel?

This includes storing raw materials, transforming them into finished products, and transporting them to consumers. The primary aim of SCM is to align supply with demand through effective logistics, making it essential for a company's success.

It involves understanding dealership management systems and basic business concepts. Knowledge of SCM is vital for success, as it helps in planning, execution, and understanding business strategies. There are various ways to pursue online or offline business, but only a few succeed, often due to a strong grasp of SCM and effective strategies.\n\n**Online vs. Offline Business:**\n- **Offline Business:** Requires a physical location and personal interactions to attract customers, along with significant investment and effort.\n- **Online Business:** Needs only a computer and internet connection, allowing for operations from home without a physical store, though it still demands hard work.\n\n**Top 5 Genuine Online Business Methods:**\n1. **Blogs/Websites:** Write articles and earn through Google AdSense.\n2. **Affiliate Marketing:** Promote products from companies like Amazon and earn commissions.\n3. **Freelancing:** Offer skills like software development on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr.\n4. **Dropshipping:** Sell products online without holding inventory through sites like Amazon or eBay.\n5. **E-commerce:** Sell products via your own website or through established e-commerce platforms.\n\n**What is Supply Chain Management?**\nSCM oversees the entire process from raw material to consumer. It involves planning and controlling various aspects of production and distribution to ensure the right product reaches the customer.\n\n**How SCM Works:**\nThe SCM process includes:\n1. Raw Material\n2. Supplier\n3. Manufacturer\n4. Retailer\n5. Customer\n6. Returns\n\n**Dealership Management Model:**\nThis model involves a dealer who sells to wholesalers, who then sell to retailers, ultimately reaching consumers. \n\n**E-commerce Strategy:**\nTo succeed in e-commerce, businesses should:\n1. Identify peak shopping times for marketing.\n2. Understand SCM thoroughly.\n3. Align with market demand through dealers.\n4. Develop good communication skills.\n5. Implement effective marketing strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding SCM and dealership management is key to success in both online and offline business ventures.",

    "content": "I'm developing a system for a chemical manufacturer to monitor inventory from raw material receipt through blending and into finished product holding tanks. The finished product is dispatched daily in tankers. In case of quality issues, they need to trace back to identify all raw materials used. Currently, this process relies on spreadsheets and the production team's memory. We've successfully implemented barcode generation and scanning for raw materials. However, we've encountered a problem: the finished product doesn't go into a single quarantined holding tank as initially stated, but rather into any available tank without established procedures. This complicates tracking the raw materials used, as there's no way to know when a batch has been depleted from the tanks. I suggest quarantining a single tank until it's full and assigning a production code to it, while using other tanks for orders. Once it's filled, the next empty tank can be quarantined, allowing for orderly dispatch of the product. Is this a good recommendation? I'm seeking insights from others involved in chemical production and raw material inventory management.",

This will help me give a better answer.\n\nAnyway, as an inventory planning manager, I would recommend a software which has inbuilt reordering workflows like - \n\n1. Should have a summary table that highlights the skus which are going to out of stock in the coming 15 days or 30 days, depending on your lead time for sourcing.   \n   Once you click on that, it should open up those skus. It should have all the relevant metrics like average sale (adjusted for out of stock days), current inventory, intransit inventory and how much to reorder. It should also consider how the product was performing in the same season, last year.\n\n2. No software is perfect. So, it should give you an option to modify the reorder quantity so that you can use your personal business intelligence. \n\n3. Currently, you are waiting for a week to sync your data. Your approach is reactive rather than proactive.  \nThe software should sync the data everyday so that you are always on top of what is going on. \n\n4. The software should have dashboards to highlight the products where you have excess inventory. It should also highlight whether the reason for this excess inventory is excess ordering in the past or minimum order quantity or sales drop. This will help you take actions on these skus and will also present you from excess ordering in the future, if its because of manual error.\n\n  \n5. The software should have an option to raise the Purchase orders and it should automatically sync when the goods are received at your warehouse against this purchase orders.   \n   This will help you stay on top of delayed deliveries. This will also help you with vendor performance metrics interms of lead time and fill rate.",

    "content": "I'm currently interning at a medium-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on the Warehouse Management System (WMS). Although I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS can assist us. Our warehouse is disorganized; items frequently go missing, and we lack a proper system. We have two warehouse employees and can store about 1,900 pallets. I believe implementing barcode labeling and scanners could improve inventory control and organization by structuring the warehouse by SKUs. I seek software for managing these SKUs and barcoding. \n\nTo enhance operations, we need better insights into goods' locations for efficient order picking and putaway, as well as data on time spent and inventory for procurement optimization. Currently, many old items linger in the warehouse due to a lack of overview and an outdated receiving process. Only two suppliers provide barcodes compatible with our scanner. \n\nHowever, I face challenges with WMS integration; vendors are uncertain about compatibility, especially with our ERP system, Exact Globe +, which has potential issues. Implementation costs are estimated at thousands of euros, and I'm unsure if it's necessary or if a standalone solution might be better. Our current process involves writing off used goods during manufacturing, which leads to inventory discrepancies, but it seems reliable.\n\nWe don't need all WMS features, just better control over our inventory and procurement data. I'm also uncertain about the quality of supplier barcodes\u2014can this be resolved with barcode printers and scanners? With only one compatible scanner, I\u2019m concerned about recommending a WMS due to potential ERP issues and high costs, especially since our company has fewer than 100 employees and a limited budget. One vendor quoted over \u20ac40,000 plus annual costs, which seems excessive. I would appreciate any guidance, as this situation feels overwhelming.",

The resources that need planning are machines, manpower and materials. The software you have is not covering any of these three.   So effectively the company is being run manually.

It is just reading numbers in a bar-font format.\n\nThe video link below is for a small business, and will give you some ideas for 1+2. It probably would not be adequate for the final WMS, but it would get you in control of inventory, and the data could be imported into a WMS later. \n\nThe video also shows how barcodes can be generated and tracked. The barcode can be designed to state which rack and isle the items are in, along with a SKU code. \n\n[https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/](https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/)\n\nNow you have a basic system in place to manage supplies. \n\n3.

Though some forecasting tools use 212 algorithms, back test them, and try to decide which model fits the items patterns.\n\nIf you're looking at a season item, then I would say look at the average of the 6 months of seasonal data to try to arrive at what to order for the upcoming season. I really think you could do that with any item, look at the past 6 months and make educated guesses going forward.",

Others suggest we should only restock according to our projections, such as for the next 30 days, which would allow us to return most of the pallet to storage. What is the best practice in this situation? Thanks.",

The Tool Coordinator will inventory a box and update it using an accessible method (ideally an app). It would also be great if the app could assign boxes to technicians, but if not, we can use an Excel sheet. \n\nMy manager wants a four-layer audit for ISO compliance, where the technician can log into the app to self-inventory their box periodically. They can request replacements for lost or broken tools or mark them as nonexistent, which would alert the coordinator. Additionally, the tool coordinator will conduct regular inspections, and there will be a final inventory check with both the technician and coordinator to ensure completeness, holding the technician accountable for any discrepancies.\n\nIs there a program that exists for this purpose?

Since you\u2019re a small business I would recommend going with a software geared toward small to medium sized businesses, as they tend to be more affordable. Fishbowl for example is a really popular inventory management system however it\u2019s VERY expensive. \n\nI would checkout Katana, Sortly, and inFlow. I personally use inFlow because of how easy it was to pick up. The UI is very intuitive and modern. Something you\u2019ll find with a lot of inventory management systems is they look like they\u2019re from the 90s.\n\nWith inFlow you can put pictures in your product descriptions and use units of measure. They also have an incredible built in barcoding system. \n\nWhatever you do make sure to do your due diligence and give a couple options a go. Many have free trials (inFlow has a 14 day free trial). Also contact the sales department for whichever software you\u2019re looking at and tell them your workflow. They will be able to tell you for sure whether or not the software can do what you need it to.",

        "content": "If the stock is moved around often (without updating the location), how can you easily identify the item?  Workers usually won't do this update step when they are moving things around and your inventory tracking will go out of sync (this is what we have seen in such scenarios.. no SOP helps).  So, when a customer comes and asks for a 20x4x3 plank, you would know you have it in stock (because of your inventory software), but would need to search the lot to find where is it placed!  This, in my opinion, would be your real problem (no SOP). \n\nIf you don't have an issue of locating the part / wood int he storage area and only concerned about easily searching and marking the item as \"sold\" (based on the ref number) in the system, then it's a straight forward thing (i.e., is not your real problem).  Any software or Excel sheet can be used for doing the inventory sales tracking. The benefit you get is, you will know what you have in stock (assuming, new entries are made when you stock up and you update the sale correctly each time, on time) and can pull up reports as you desire.\n\nPlease correct me here if I am wrong.",

For e.g Item ABC needs to be picked from Location XYZ for fulfilling a sales order, then you need more than inventory management, and you get into the warehouse management territory - checkout Hopstack, Shipedge, Infoplus, etc\n\nNow, if you want to manage work orders as well to transform one form of received items into another form before it becomes sellable. For e.g if you receive, a log of wood that undergoes, cutting, polishing and finishing to become plywood, then you need either an ERP or a WMS system that has the work order functionality. You can again consider something like Zoho, Hopstack, Netsuite etc but all these functionalities typically cost upwards of $20k annually.",

For example, Product A originally had PARs of 94 max and 50 min, which I changed to 70 and 40. The unit cost for Product A is $918.67. I aim to show a total savings of $31,234.78 by calculating the reductions from both minimum and maximum PARs (34 units). However, my colleague argues that I can only report the maximum PAR savings, totaling $22,048.08 from a 24-unit reduction. Any insights would be helpful!",

This goes being minimum lot sizes, but the current on hand inventory may dictate whether to expedite the next shipment or not to achieve your target service levels.\nI used to work with a service manager who would love to get into fights with me because of there being no inventory to repair stuff. But guess what, he refused to make sure his team properly keyed inventory that was moved which led to over a $1 million dollars of inventory that actually existed but weren't on the books...

    "content": "Hello, I work as a development associate at a small non-profit animal shelter. One of my responsibilities is to count donations and enter them into our database, which tracks Fair Market values for donors and our records. My typical day involves: \n- Manually counting donated pet food and supplies and recording them.\n- Entering data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.\n- Conducting manual research for Fair Market Values, mainly using Google unless a receipt is available.\n- More data entry as we upload the information into our donor database.\n\nIs there a way to implement a scanner to help us keep track of donated items? We would like to scan the barcodes on pet food bags and supplies to automatically populate a spreadsheet with details such as amount donated, brand, type of food, weight, and Fair Market value. For example: 1 bag of PEDIGREE Adult Dog Dry Food (Grilled steak and vegetable flavors), 44 lbs, $29.98; 1 Fresh Step Multi-Cat Scented Litter, 25 lbs, $17.59. Since we rely entirely on donations, it's crucial for us to maintain an accurate count of incoming supplies, as we can't afford to order or purchase items. Thank you!",

    "content": "I've been in business for five years and recently received a form from the city regarding Personal Property Tax. They now ask how I calculate my year-end inventory\u2014FIFO, LIFO, COST, RETAIL, or OTHER. Previously, the form only required my monthly purchases and a copy of my Schedule C. As a thrift store, I pay cash for items, often using a tiered payment system: 30% for low-end clothing brands, 40% for high-end, and 50% for toys and baby gear. When I receive large quantities of clothing, the price I pay per item decreases with the number of items. It's impractical to track the purchase price of each individual item since I have over 18,000 items in my store. I keep track of my total monthly expenditures for budgeting but can't specify what I paid for each item. I periodically walk the store to clear out unsold items, and I often have 20-30 totes waiting to be processed. When I discussed my inventory challenges with my accountant, they suggested estimating that about 12-15% of my inventory remains unsold at year-end. For instance, if I spent $25,650 on merchandise, I would report around $3,078 as leftover inventory. I can count my items but can't determine the exact purchase price for each one. Can anyone help me understand this issue better? I feel overwhelmed.",

A worker loads the materials and puts the ticket into a bin. 5. At the end of the day, the manager manually enters the ticket into the inventory system, which is time-consuming and outdated. This method causes delays in tracking inventory, increases the likelihood of errors, and results in lost tickets due to disorganization. Customers often get confused because our inventory system may show items as available when they're not. I\u2019m considering implementing a barcode system or developing an app to address these issues. Any advice on how to proceed or other suggestions would be appreciated!",

It seems like the biggest decision is how or if you will mark the material and what the workflow will be like.\n\nWith commodity lumberr you probably don't want to mark every single piece or it may already have a barcode. If you have exotic one of a kind specialty pieces then you would probably want to barcode every piece. Honestly creating your own barcode labels with custom pricing and other information is a surprisingly difficult problem. You can do that with Shopify  if you get an add-on like I think it's called barcode man.",

We want to assign a unique serial number to each part to track details such as who soldered, tested it, its performance, and any issues. These parts will then be assembled into a unit. Ideally, when I select a unit in the software, it would expand to display all sub-components, along with a \"Location\" field to indicate where each unit is located. We don't require features like invoice tracking, PO processing, or shipping labels; we simply need to monitor each component and its assembly into a unit. Currently, we use EZOfficeInventory for tracking but are finding it insufficient. I tried Zoho, but it seems overly complex for our needs. I considered using Excel, but it likely won't suffice for organizing multiple parts into units at different locations. I would appreciate any advice on suitable solutions or guidance. Thank you!",

I can imagine the hardest part to your use-case is assigning an individual cost to each part that comes off a machine. In some ways maybe its just easier to assign cost by weight. if a machine is 500lbs and you pay $500 and a carburetor weights 20lbs then its costs $20.\n\na good starting point might be to look for inventory softwares with \"disassembly feature\" or \"coproducts/byproducts\" features.",

Work with your accounting team and engineers to make sure there is a checkout process from inventory that will be followed. There's no point doing a full cycle count without a process that everyone in the company agrees to follow to maintain the inventory count. This may also have implications for your ERP/Inventory system (if you have one). This will probably take a while to nail down.\n3. You'll need to do a full cycle count. If you think you can count all of your inventory over 2 days (this depends on your team size and inventory size) then I'd recommend closing the inventory over a weekend and going through shelf by shelf with your team and any volunteers. It'll be important to notate - part number, location, quantity, unit of measure for everything you find. I'd keep these counts in a separate Excel, not in a system\n   1. If you can't do all the counting over a weekend, break it up into sections you can do over a weekend (so you don't have to close down the inventory for the week). Once a section is complete, that section **must** follow the agreed upon inventory check out process from step 2, otherwise the work will be for nothing.\n4. Once you have a process in place, and the existing quantities for your parts, work with your accounting team to determine what parts should be brought back into inventory. Use what you found in step 1, i.e. which parts matter, and which don't, to determine which part quantities you care about\n5. Your accounting team should be able to help you correctly determine the accounting entries that are needed after you present the parts and quantities the company cares about, and which they no longer need. This will be the inventory adjustment that will likely lead to your accounting team doing a write off.  \n\n\nHope that makes sense! Happy to go into any additional detail as needed. Note if you're using Quickbooks to track inventory quantities, you really should get another system. Something like [Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlinventory.com/), [Redshift](https://redshift-app.com/), or [Katana](https://katanamrp.com/). Unless you need a full ERP - which begins a second discussion :D",

We\u2019ve been exploring IMS solutions since we currently track inventory bi-weekly using a basic spreadsheet. We\u2019ve identified FishBowl and Katana as two strong contenders for our needs. Presently, we use HubSpot CRM for client interactions, and when a deal is marked \"Closed Won,\" we transfer that data to Smartsheet via Make (API). We're looking for three unbiased reviews each for Katana and FishBowl, separate from their case studies. While G2 and similar sites are useful, we\u2019re particularly interested in testimonials regarding the integration of HubSpot CRM with either FishBowl or Katana. We\u2019re concerned that the HubSpot native connections offered by both may not function as intended, similar to our past experience with ODOO, which had integration issues. I believe Katana and FishBowl should handle deal information from HubSpot well, but I would greatly appreciate any personal experiences, testimonials, or feedback about this integration. If you need more context, please let me know! Thank you for any insights or suggestions for alternative sources of information beyond G2 or SoftwareAdvice.com.",

I\u2019ve done numerous Katana implementations and advising (I was on their founding team) and have worked in Hubspot with sales. \n\nFor your use-case are you trying to get custom information associated with a hubspot deal into the ERP? Just curious, since you are doing custom wood-workings. \n\nOne major difference with Katana and Fishbowl is that Fishbowl doesn\u2019t have a robust Shop floor functionality nor a make to order workflow which is functionally important for custom manufacturing. Both do inventory processes and BOMs just fine. \n\nIf Make.com has the capability to tap into all elements of the Katana sales API then you can put details of your CRM deal from Hubspot into multiple parts of a Katana sales order. This would include sales order notes/comments, line item specific metadata (<===use that for a custom make to order manufacturing process available in paperless format for floor team) and lastly the new custom fields available in the Katana platform which is currently in Beta (not sure if API is open to that endpoint yet)\n\nIn general, these would be the possibilities for your integration to sales order details. I\u2019m not sure there are enough use cases yet covering the hubspot integration via make.com to even draw in an opinion to this since every use-case has some nuances in the workflow.",

Base it off of sales volume rather than prices and promos.  \n\nExample if in one week, store A sells 200/500 Samsung Galaxy S23s then order 100 to replenish their inventory \n\nA quick note with this method, depending on your purchase order lead time you can either order more or less (I have a 90 day lead time for my purchase orders so I generally order extra qty)\n\nAnother option for you is what I call inventory transfers. Let's say the Google Pixel Fold is selling quite well at store C (21 on hand) (30 sold in two weeks) but experiencing slow sales at store A (89 on hand) (9 sold in two weeks) you can inventory transfer 25 units from store A to replenish store C rather than placing a new purchase order. \n\nAlso is it possible for your 3 managers to cut their purchase orders back to once a week? Twice a week is possibly too often and might be creating stale inventory. \n\nJust a quick caveat, I'm not sure how much inventory you're able to stock per your 3 stores, so adjust my hypothetical figures accordingly. (I deal in qtys of 100s and operate a 55,000 sq ft warehouse and a 30,000 sq ft warehouse.) So I am just accustomed to dealing with quite a bit of space for my product. \n\nTL;DR, I believe the inventory transfer method can help you the most with your current stale inventory and have your 3 managers base your future purchase orders off of weekly sales volume and less off of promos and prices.",

I've dealt with many clients who overestimate the benefits and underestimate the costs (workload, time, money, skills required) of getting a new system. Not to mention the additional costs of choosing the wrong system or using an inexperienced implementation firm that sends a sales rep who sells you on a system that will do \"all that AND THEN SOME!\" I've even advised a client not to upgrade because their current system provided the timely, accurate, and reliable managerial reports they needed to make informed business decisions.\n\nSo, take your time, slow your roll, and start by forming an implementation team that can thoroughly assess the \"current state\" and \"future state\" of your company and help lead a successful implementation. That's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend. To save time and help you plan your project, use AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to create a complete step-by-step implementation plan built upon best practices of project management. Tailor the methodology for a \\[industry\\] company with \\[# employees\\] and {annual} in revenue from \\[list revenue streams\\].\n\nMake sure to thoroughly vet any consultant's by reviewing their professional experience on their LinkedIn.  I'm currently wrapping up a implementation that started our efforts and discussions around Katana, then providing a 2-day walk-through visit by two \"consultants\" and then to a full 180 when they suggested we go with CIN7 because it had features Katana didn't. I can't help to feel that these guys totally pulled a bait-and-switch on my buddies shop!  Learn from my own mistake and request many demos, especially around system functionality and integration abilities so you can make your final purchase decision confidently.  Well, the two ended leaving that company and forming one of their own.  My buddies had no choice to continue using them because you're not supposed to switch consultants mid-implemention like that.  DM me if you want the name of the firm.   \n  \nI definitely spent WAAAAY to much time writing this out but gladly do it again if it helps prevent someone from getting bamboozled by these fake consultants.

Currently, each bin has a paper label indicating its contents, but my partner struggles to read them, particularly for bins on the ground or high up. Does anyone have experience with short-range Bluetooth locating devices or similar apps? Ideally, I want a solution where he can input a product name or SKU into an app that directs him to the correct bin, either through phone directions or auditory signals. I've seen systems for tracking items between warehouses, but we only have one. Since the bins are frequently rearranged when pulling products for shipping, we need something that updates automatically. Any suggestions?",

My inventory consists of parts for industrial machine repairs, but there's a communication gap between the shop crew and the purchasing department. Sometimes, the shop crew takes parts for jobs without notifying purchasing, leading us to backtrack when we notice discrepancies. I propose using QR codes on the inventory parts that link to a form. When filled out, this form will update a spreadsheet with the part and job numbers, allowing us to allocate costs correctly. Since every shop employee has a tablet to scan QR codes, I believe this could be an effective solution. While I see potential for future expansion, I'm unsure about the company's technological resources for further automation. If anyone has experience creating a QR code system and can share tips, I would appreciate it! I'm currently aiming for a no-cost solution that I can manage myself. The inventory volume is manageable right now, so I think a simple approach like this could work until I can develop a more advanced system.",

I discovered a poorly organized Excel sheet, and despite trying to improve it with various versions, I'm still not satisfied. The volume of materials is large, and manually entering 50 serial numbers repeatedly to update their status from \"stored\" to \"sent\" feels tedious. Price isn't an issue for us since we send materials to other locations without charging or purchasing; we simply distribute what arrives. It's crucial to keep a record of all serial numbers for each product, along with the date, location, serial number, and incident number after sending. I'm unsure whether to invest in specialized software or to find a better Excel template to adapt. What do you recommend? Thank you!",

You would also need to consider the minimum order quantity depending on the supplier, lead time, and par levels for each SKU. The complexity increases with commissary/central kitchen models.

This allows for easier and more accurate tracking, as you can scan the barcode when sheets are received, used, or replenished. It also enables integration with inventory management software.\n\n2. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification): RFID tags can be attached to each sheet, and RFID readers placed at various locations in your facility can automatically detect and track the movement of the sheets. This method provides real-time visibility and eliminates the need for manual counting.\n\n3. Weight sensors: If the weight of the sheets is consistent and can be measured accurately, you can use weight sensors or load cells placed on storage racks or shelves. The system can monitor the weight changes to determine when sheets are added or removed.\n\n4. Visual indicators: You can implement a visual signaling system using colored tags or markers to indicate the quantity of sheets in stock. For example, using red tags when the stock is low and green tags when it's sufficient. This method provides a quick visual reference, but it still relies on manual observation.\n\nIf you need some custom Software or similar, feel free to DM me :)",

    "content": "I recently joined my audit team for an internal store audit. They are currently categorizing items by code and storing them alongside similar materials, but the organization is informal. While every rack has a number, these numbers aren't integrated into the system. When items are received, they are logged into our ERP for inventory tracking and then manually recorded in an Excel sheet to indicate their location. I aim to improve this process to enhance efficiency in stock management and provide real-time inventory visibility. Currently, when items are issued to departments, they disappear from our ERP stock list but remain in the Excel locator until manually updated during weekly stock checks. I propose integrating locators into our ERP and assigning each item a designated locator. This would clarify item locations and automatically update the system when items are removed, eliminating manual tasks and minimizing errors. Has anyone implemented a similar system in their company? Is it worth considering from a cost-benefit perspective? Any suggestions on how to proceed?",

There\u2019s a problem with people claiming their packages without a log to verify it. We're considering a system where S+R can scan each box's barcode into a spreadsheet, recording the name, date/time, and who scanned it. While we know this can be done in Google Sheets or Excel, we want to keep it as simple as possible, avoiding complex warehouse management software. We\u2019d also like the current date and time to auto-populate. Is there a straightforward software solution for this, or can we set up a Google Sheet to function this way? Thanks!",

Ability to rent and book equipment for specific dates 3. Categorization of equipment 4. Pricing calculations based on daily, weekly, or monthly rates 5. Potential client-specific discounts 6. Payment via credit card or purchase order reference 7. Exclusion of pickup date from pricing.\n\nFor our internal inventory management, we need: 1. Equipment as individual items that can also be part of a kit 2. Marking items as inactive due to defects or theft 3. Items inactive due to expired calibration 4. Document attachment for equipment (like calibration certificates) 5. Simplified check-in/check-out process (considering barcodes or QR codes) 6. Printable rental forms with serial numbers and a comment section for client signatures upon pickup 7. Standard depreciation and insurance tracking 8. Invoice generation.\n\nMost existing solutions are too cumbersome, but I realize the wishlist might lead to such options. I remember seeing an unfinished solution on Reddit but can't locate it now. We are open to paying a reasonable amount and are considering all types of solutions, like WordPress plugins. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

We usually stock extra items that typically need replacement and materials for equipment installation. For instance, when we order a parking gate with an intercom and loops, we generally have the filler and loop in stock, but need to order the gate and intercom. Similarly, we might receive cameras for a customer that are sold within the same week. We deal with many low-quantity items annually, as well as some high-quantity ones. Currently, we lack a proper inventory tracking system; we only perform a year-end count without any insight into what has been added or removed throughout the year, apart from billed items. I'm sure there's a more efficient way to organize this without requiring complex software. Can anyone assist?",

We have over 8,000 unique SKUs in TAM Intelliware, and it's quite disorganized. My main concern is that I recently purchased some socks, many of which are already in our system. However, the prices vary\u2014some were bought at higher prices in the last order and others at lower prices. Should I manually adjust the purchase price? Won't that affect previous records and leave me without past cost information? If I don\u2019t update to current purchase prices, our COGS will be inaccurate. I also want to avoid creating a new entry for the same item. Is there a resource where I can learn about this? I feel like I'm navigating this alone, and there doesn't seem to be a consistent method for managing our inventory and records. I\u2019d like to simplify things and establish a better process.",

We're using Scout TopShelf for inventory management, and I'm working on establishing reorder points and economic order quantities for our 20 most frequently ordered hardware items. I've researched extensively, reading around 20 articles on inconsistent demand, reorder points, and EOQ, and I also hold a bachelor's degree in operations where I studied these topics. However, I\u2019m struggling to set reasonable reorder points due to our seasonal demand. Can anyone advise me on how to establish sensible yet conservative reorder points and EOQ for this seasonal demand? Should I adjust the formulas quarterly, or would it be better to implement safety stock? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!",

I can set up a database in Excel or Access to catalog the products and their information. However, my boss wants to introduce a barcode or QR code system for future inventory management. I can generate unique barcodes for each product and update their labels accordingly. I realize that adding new products will require manual entry into the database to include the new label and barcode. My main question is whether there's a way to set up a system that removes the corresponding product from the database when a barcode is scanned. If Excel or Access isn't suitable for this, I would appreciate any software recommendations. Please let me know if you need more details, as I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and would appreciate any assistance. Thank you.",

    "content": "Recognizing a niche market and a consistent client base, I decided to enhance my approach beyond merely referring business to brokers by obtaining broker authority. I reached out to two familiar carriers I've worked with extensively, each having 4-6 skilled drivers, to see if they would be interested in taking on a few over-dimensional loads each month. They informed me that their insurance payment was just made, and their authority would be on hold before Christmas. They are overwhelmed with work, and I suspect they may not be in the country legally, fearing that trucking through weigh stations could lead to deportation. I've known these individuals for over a decade, and while I could be mistaken, cash flow doesn\u2019t seem to be the issue. I'm starting to wonder how many carriers and drivers aren't fully documented U.S. citizens, which could potentially remove a significant number of drivers from the roads\u2014possibly over 30%. Companies like \"Jim and John\u2019s Lumber Co\" (fictitious) will likely be shocked when full truckloads cost $4.50/mile instead of the previously low rates of $1.80/mile. January is shaping up to be a politically significant month for me, even compared to January 2020.",

Work with executives to prepare for lobbying meetings in DC. Some companies got exemptions last time around. It just takes the time, manpower, and money. I moved to a midsize company and they had no idea that was going on. \n3. Work with your Chinese suppliers to shift any remaining spend over to other LCCS countries. Much of that work has already been done but I'm sure there's more we'll have to do there\n4. If they can't shift to another country, ask for cost reductions\n5.

The rising costs in Europe and clients wanting high-quality work for lower prices make it feel impossible. I have a capable team, but I don't understand how small and medium businesses are managing under this pressure. I run a trucking company, and we've recently reduced our fleet due to decreased post-COVID demand and fierce competition where everyone is vying for the lowest prices. It feels like a battle of attrition, and I'm curious how other companies are coping. Is it even feasible to operate in this market? How are you handling the situation? Thank you for any insights.",

Ranges from simple intake to actual 4PL models.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. In/out - which should encompass everything as far as offload/reload, getting it to its spot and any sort labeling that they do internally.\n\n2. Storage - self explanatory \n\n3. Order Entry - so this every time an order is sent. It doesn’t matter how many shipments this results in, there’s a charge. \n\n4. Pick & Pack - this is if you client has multiple sku’s and they send you FCLs/FTLs with one sku that eventually need to be broken down to create a pallet with multiple sku’s on it.\n\n5. Additional material, labor, etc. - this is like pallet charges, wrapping charges, man labor if a container tipped over and you need someone to restack this etc.\n\nIf you do international: customs, ocean/air etc. is next. Then final mile charges. Then if you have a WMS system and they want to be able to login, you’ll need to charge them an integration fee (and bump the order entry fee to make up for all the fees of them inputting loads now)\n\nFor reference, I own 200K sq ft in Miami. We have FTZ space and bonded space, the below is about an avg. charge per the above scope:\n\n1. $20/$20\n2. $35\n3. $22\n4. $0.65\n5. Varies\n\nHope this helps.",

        "content": "In order to make more money in the logistic space generally speaking, you need to move up from the line level into supervision and or leadership roles, or some kind of specialty role, like inventory management or IT. The first step in terms of determining where to go, is to look at your set of skills. What do you enjoy most about the job? What do you consider key strengths of yours? If you have a strong attention detail and are good with numbers inventory or financial analysis would be good places to explore. If you’re a hard worker, dedicated and can show up every day, have good communication skills then looking to get into a lead role or management role would be something to consider. If you’re great at written communication, email, problem solving and friendly on the phone. Client services would be something to consider. Once you determine what you think would be the best fit. The next step would be to talk to someone that you get along with on your leadership team. Explain to them that you’re interested in career progression and you’re willing to put in the work. Tell them that you think you would be good at whatever mightier might be and ask for their help, in getting some exposure to different opportunities. Some logistics companies have some type of management training programs that you might be able to participate in.  Minimally you could volunteer to assist whoever the lead person might be to start to get a better feel for a particular role so that you can understand if it’s something you feel would be a good fit. When you can find something that you like, and that you’re good at then work becomes a lot easier, and your career progression will be faster. All of these will pay you more than 45k a year and as you move up in higher management roles,, you could make 100K or more. Keep in mind that the trade-off for more money is always harder work in many cases longer hours and in almost all cases higher levels of responsibility that come with more pressure. That’s just the trade-off in this business for higher wages.",

For immediate action, organizations deploy adaptive traffic signals, reroute traffic, and use live updates for drivers. Advanced technologies like AI-driven traffic cameras can detect bottlenecks and adjust traffic light patterns in real time. Long-term solutions include building alternate routes, improving public transit, and promoting staggered work hours to reduce peak traffic. Some cities also use congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter high-traffic zones. A mix of these strategies has proven effective in minimizing gridlock and keeping traffic flowing.",

For the simple reason that our need moving product through the supply chain continues to grow.\n\nBack in 2020, many companies scrambled to find warehouse space to overcome the flow interruptions.  Some segments are seeing a retraction over the past year and this was not a surprise.  There are two main reasons.  First is that with the flow of goods restored to a more steady and reliable movement, there is less need to hold excess inventory and pay extra for contingency plans.  Second is that companies are reevaluating their supply chain networks to ensure the operations are optimized.  Many short-term decisions were made in 2020 that can be improved upon now that life is back to a more steady state.",

I have a background in logistics, mainly focusing on sea and air freight, along with experience in management and finance, giving me above-average knowledge but still some limitations. I'm looking to import a laptop from the US to South Africa since purchasing it here comes with a hefty markup (around $1k). As a US citizen, I prefer to get it from my family rather than importing from other countries. DHL quoted me about $450, which is quite high, plus potential duties. I'm shipping to a residential address, hoping that helps. Can anyone recommend a shipper or forwarder who could offer a much lower rate? While I know it won't be $50, I could manage around $200. Additionally, some trusted friends might visit soon, and I'm checking if they can bring the laptop. I'll also contact some old forwarder connections. Thanks for your help!",

The operations of a carrier get affected by the currency fluctuations that happen on a daily basis. Some currency changes can be so drastic that it affects the operability. This is addressed by the CAF. \nSome carriers, though few now, charge it as a % of the freight (they used to) but it is cumbersome to maintain so they have a lump sum dollar amount. It generally covers every situation but even if any drastic changes between one currency pair results in some operability issues it is compensated by the profit from another.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I’m seeking advice on managing VAT and import costs for shipments from our factory in Hong Kong to a client in the Netherlands. We produce knitwear and ship large orders for fashion brands, but we've recently faced significant charges, including about 30% in taxes—21% Dutch VAT plus additional import duties—totaling nearly 50% of the goods' value. This impacts our margins, especially since this client constitutes 20-30% of our annual turnover. I have a few questions: 1. VAT Recovery: Is there a way to reclaim Dutch VAT? We receive a bill from DHL after shipping. Would registering for VAT in the Netherlands help, or are there other options? 2. Reducing Import Costs: Any suggestions for lowering import duties or fees? Can tariff codes, trade agreements, or similar strategies be utilized? 3. Shipping Strategies: Would altering our shipping or customs process help reduce costs? Has anyone experienced similar issues? Any tips would be greatly appreciated, as this client is vital to us, and we need to improve our shipment costs. Thank you! EDIT: I forgot to mention we are based in the UK, and our client has a warehouse in both the UK and the Netherlands.",

When entering the EU, the import is subject to VAT and duty. The importer should pay the VAT and seek reimbursement from the local customs via monthly declaration. They can get VAT reimbursement while you can't. For the duty, if any, he can pay it also and then seek reimbursement from you.\n\n  \nI have a customer who sends containers from Israel to Portugal. He agreed to Delivery Duty Paid with the BUYER. We clear the container using the Importer's VAT and charge the importer the duty. Then, we send the exporter a copy of the import customs clearance that shows the VAT/DUTY with instructions to reimburse the buyer for the duty.\n\n  \n[https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg)\n\nField 47  \nA00: DUTY, %6.5 on 32966.59€, 2142.83€.

The answer is yes, the only liability you incur is if CBP performs an inspection and the items they flag should have records of what it is and it's current entry status (inbond/cleared). Best practice is to outlay the flooring of your warehouse to clearly distinguish where bonded goods are stored. Usually, this is already setup as CBP performs accreditation checks when approving bonded facilities. Hope this helps!",

You can amend the UOM (how many cases per pallet, how many units per case), and do what others have also suggested of wrapping and securing the shipment. But that is all moot if you don’t have the adequate insurance coverage for your load. Clarify your insurance coverage first.",

Try getting your shipment out of an LAX terminal and you may have nightmares for years to come. I actually do, I have literally had nightmares about begging WFS to just give me my shipment while they hold it hostage for no reason. \n\nBut honestly we need more details to provide a true comparison, different shipments have different profiles and risks.

    "content": "Yesterday, I bought two items on eBay and sent them to my new MyUS.com account. Unfortunately, I couldn't select international shipping directly with these sellers. The packages are set to be delivered to my address in Poland. I've just noticed the many negative reviews for MyUS.com, which I should have checked earlier... my oversight :( Since the packages are on their way to the MyUS warehouse in Sarasota, FL (expected to arrive tomorrow), I’d like your advice on configuring my account to avoid unexpected fees and taxes. Here’s what I’ve done so far: 1. I opted for a Premium account for the first month with no initial fee, allowing 30 days without storage fees and the option to consolidate the packages for shipping. 2. I plan to delete my account once the packages arrive instead of switching to a free membership, as I’ve read some incur a $10 fee for that switch. I assume deleting my account won’t have any charges? 3. I prefer the ‘DPD Powered by Aramex’ shipping option over ‘Budget Economy.’ The DPD option requires selecting ‘Duties and Taxes’ to be included with the shipping fee, which seems convenient but might lead to high charges, as I’ve heard they can overcharge VAT as ‘3rd party costs.’ 4. I set the ‘Merchandise shipping schedule’ to ‘Hold’ because I want to initiate the shipping order myself once both packages are in the system. I’ve seen reviews where people were surprised by automatic shipping and unexpected charges. 5. I opted out of ‘Enhanced Liability Protection.’ Is spending an extra $3.5 on that worthwhile? 6. I also opted out of ‘Urgent Handling’ to avoid extra fees. 7. In ‘Packing Options,’ I left everything unselected. Is there any benefit to shipping in original boxes (if possible)? They don’t mention any fees for that. Do you have any other tips for preparing for my MyUS.com experience? It’s somewhat funny that I’m worrying about potential issues due to my own oversight, and I'm bracing myself for a possible struggle with their customer service 😊 Please reassure me!",

You probably need to arrange for standards certification before clearing German Customs ahead of time such as but not limited to  adjustments to the headlights, emissions systems, and other safety features. Vehicles must meet the Euro 6 standards, which significantly limit the levels of exhaust emissions. Post importation you'd need to go through:\n\n* **Vehicle Registration:** To have a vehicle that’s legally recognized, the owner needs to register it with the local authorities. This registration process involves submitting proof of ownership, insurance, and a valid identification card.\n* **Technical Inspection:** A mandatory technical inspection (TÜV) is required to ensure the vehicle meets all German road safety and environmental standards.\n* **Modifications:** If any modifications were necessary to meet import standards, proof of these changes might be required at registration.\n\nYou probably need both a German freight forwarder slash Customs broker as well as a Legal expert to get this done. By the time you succeed (not entirely guaranteed) you will have spent enough to buy 10 motorcycles locally.\n\n**My best advice: don't**",

After the trip, we sent the awards via FedEx to my Chicago office for distribution to the winners. However, the shipment is currently held up in Memphis due to a requirement for a steel mill license for the stands. There are about 16 awards valued at $216 USD. Does anyone have advice on how to resolve this? I believe a steel mill license shouldn't be necessary given the low value and that the items are for personal use, not for resale.",

        "content": "Just to give an update! I did it. Went to buy a small size box at u-haul for $1.56, backing peanuts for $7, and clear shipping tape to hold the printed label for $4 to $6. I can't remember what I spent on the tape. I used bubble wrap I had on hand. Not sure that that would have cost. \nCreated a UPS account. Received a shipping discount from having a UPS account. \nGround shipping with insurance was $48 instead of $93. I think the PlayStation 4 I am shipping is not as big and heavy as the PS5 I shipped. So that will also reduce the price a bit. It is $48 to ship the PS4 myself. I used the UPS store to pack and ship the PS5 for $93. \nTo be clear the PS4 shipped myself came with a 22% discount. If I applied that discount to the PS5 shipping price of $93 it would have been $72.54. UPS packing was $30.\nPacking the PS4 myself was around $12-$15.\n\nSo to compare apples to apples. UPS store for insurance and packaging was $123 for shipping ground. For the PS5. \nFor me to ship through the UPS .com myself:\nU-haul cost was $7+$1.56+$5\nUPS $48 for the PS4\n\nLet's say I shipped the PS5 myself.\nPotential cost would have been\n$72.54 rounded up to the nearest dollar would be\n$73 with insurance\nPacking it myself would have been roughly $15\nTotal cost to ship PS5 myself:\n$88. \nTo compare the PS5 store vs shipping PS5 myself:\n\n$123 UPS store \n$88 myself\nEquals and savings of around $35 if I had shipped the PS5 myself.\nThat's a 28.46% savings.\n\nIf I take pictures (which I did) of how I packed the device. I'm hoping I can collect insurance money if needed. To cover any shipping related problems. I'm sure that would not be easy either way. From what I read and hear. It's not easy to collect insurance money from UPS Shipping related problems. \n\nI, of course considered all the suggestions and ideas given in the comment section. To figure out what would be the best/ Cost-Effective way to ship a Coast-to-Cost package here in the US. I'm sure there are even better ways to acquire more savings. I'm going to continuously monitor this Reddit thread. \n\nI'm excited to see what other suggestions and ideas can be found and utilized to save more money in the future. \n\nPlease let me know what you think. I feel like this may be a good solution. Shipping myself could equal a 28.46% savings per shipment. That will add up to quite a bit of savings after 10 deliveries and beyond.",

We are The Boston Typewriter Orchestra, an 8-member group using manual typewriters, each weighing 30-40 pounds. Previously, we struggled to transport our typewriters for gigs beyond driving distance, as flying with them was problematic. FedEx Freight Box offered a solution by providing a large cardboard box for our gear, allowing us to ship to Florida for under $300. While the logistics were smooth and the staff helpful, the account management system was a disaster, requiring multiple calls to set up different types of accounts. I spent 1.5 hours on the phone for my first shipment due to website issues. Unfortunately, I’ve been over-billed twice, with one charge for a residential pickup despite using the freight depot. The first billing issue remains unresolved, and the second shipment resulted in a $2,800 bill instead of the expected $249. The collections team has been unhelpful and unresponsive. I want to continue using the Freight Box service for upcoming tours, but the administrative challenges are discouraging. 1. FedEx, please assist with the billing error of $2,800 versus $249. 2. FedEx, please improve your administrative processes; I want to appreciate the Freight Box service.",

    "content": "I'm sharing my initial comment to clarify my reasons for posting. For the community: do your businesses balance technology adoption with the need for flexibility in supply chains, or is this not a current focus? I recently attended the IMD Leading the Future Supply Chain program, which reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and provided new insights into the evolving landscape of supply chain management. A significant topic was Supply Chain 5.0 and its link to Industry 4.0 technologies. \n\nSo, what is Supply Chain 5.0? It represents an evolution from Industry 4.0, which emphasizes digital transformation through IoT, AI, robotics, and big data. In contrast, Supply Chain 5.0 focuses on a human-centric approach, merging advanced technology with human intelligence and creativity to create a resilient, adaptable, and sustainable supply chain.\n\nWhy does this matter for Industry 4.0? While Industry 4.0 has equipped us with tools for automation and optimization, Supply Chain 5.0 enhances this by integrating the human element. It stresses the need for collaboration between digital systems and human expertise to improve problem-solving, foster innovation, and respond effectively to market changes.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chain: Collaboration Between People and Technology. The program highlighted that the essence of Supply Chain 5.0 is collaborative intelligence—utilizing machine learning and AI for data analysis while empowering humans to interpret and apply this data creatively and strategically. This not only boosts operational efficiency but also aligns supply chain practices with sustainability and ethical standards, addressing consumer and regulatory demands for responsible business practices.\n\nKey Takeaways from the IMD Program: \n1. Digital Transformation is Essential, but Human Insight is Irreplaceable: Technology should enhance human capabilities, not replace them.\n2. Sustainability and Resilience Go Hand-in-Hand: Supply Chain 5.0 allows for efficient and socially responsible systems.\n3. Preparedness for the Unexpected: Combining human intelligence with real-time data helps anticipate disruptions and respond agilely.\n\nMoving forward, it's evident that the future of supply chain management will intertwine high-tech innovation with human intuition. I look forward to sharing more insights on applying these learnings in our operations to advance in this dynamic field. Let’s embrace the journey toward a more connected, adaptive, and human-centric supply chain! 🤝💡",

This is due to the reasons you mentioned; human insight is still irreplaceable within the supply chain world.\n\nToday, the most effective way to implement Industry 4.0 is to start from a human-centric approach - understanding existing human work processes and integrating digital solutions to enhance/accelerate them (rather than replacing them altogether). \n\nIt'll take a long time before we are truly able to remove the human element out of the equation. Until then, we need to understand how to best mesh man and machine together.",

My background is limited to logistics coordination, making this a significant learning experience. I'm struggling to understand the business context necessary for collecting and utilizing data effectively. I find it more challenging to comprehend the data related to Sales and Marketing than the software and technical skills.

        "content": "They should be teaching you that, it’s the point of an internship.\n\nIn general, you’re using sales out data to make forecasting decisions. I myself am a demand planner, so I’ll try to help, but I’m not always great at dumbing it down to put it plainly.\n\nSales and marketing needs to know how much of product X sold over Y time period. There’s a few different situations they may be trying to discern:\n\n1. How is Product X selling? Good? Bad? Selling below, at, or above forecast? Selling below, at, or above other products in its category? Performing better or worse YOY if an ongoing product? Does it exhibit seasonality (sells better during certain times and worse the rest of the time)? \n\n2. How is Promotion A performing? Marketing planned and executed a promotion for 10% off Product X in October, how did that affect sales of Product X? \n\n3. How does Product X perform relative to other products you sell? Is it a top SKU (A SKU), middle SKU (B SKU), or shit tier SKU (C or even worse, D SKU)? \n\n4. If sales and marketing is considering launching a new product, how does products similar to that product sell? \n\nThere’s lots more situations, but these are some common ones I deal with relative to sales and marketing. Some of the more specific situations are channel specific, such as how many units sell per store on average? There is different situations and insights if we are presenting to upper management or finance (more big picture financial stuff like are your forecasts meeting current company trend forecast or are you above/below? How’s your overall forecast bias? What’s your unproductive inventory situation?)\n\nMost of your insights will be derived from unit sales. You will want to confirm if they need their insights in units or in dollars. If in dollars, you will want to convert your insights from units to either gross or net sales depending on the situation. \n\nThis is highly simplified and obviously what we do is much more nuanced than this. \n\nAnd again, this is stuff they should be teaching you. Demand planning is indeed a higher level job that kind of combines supply chain concepts with business concepts and requires a good understanding of business math, KPIs, interpretation, statistics, and critical thinking among other things.",

After that, I plan to pursue an MBA at ASU, focusing on either general business or supply chain. However, I seek opinions on whether the $40k investment for the master's is worthwhile. I'm 27, living in Phoenix, AZ, and I hold an associate degree in Business (MCC, 2019) and a bachelor's in Finance (ASU, 2021), with three years of experience at a lead investing firm in a non-licensed role. I intend to research supply chain areas of interest in the coming weeks. I enjoyed a basic supply chain class during my senior year at ASU, but I'm uncertain if it was just a passing interest or a career path for me, yet I enrolled in the certificate program, which I'm seriously considering. My future goal is to earn a comfortable salary. While I prefer not to work at a desk, I feel limited by my skills and background. I dislike the idea of returning for an MBA, but if it helps me achieve my goals, I'm willing to invest. I also aspire to work remotely or in a travel-friendly role, even if it takes time to reach that position. ASU is introducing a SCM Procurement certificate for under $2k, which I might pursue to enhance my credentials alongside or instead of the MBA, as both certificates count towards MBA credits. I'm also considering obtaining the certificates first, gaining experience, and seeking a company to fund my MBA if possible. Currently, I earn about $54k and cannot afford to pay out of pocket, which is a significant factor in my decision. Any advice or recommendations?",

Most definitely. \n\nI will say this as a hiring manager - if I’m hiring an entry level position I don’t care if your degree is in underwater basket weaving if you can demonstrate how you can solve my problem. I need an entry level demand planner… how are you at excel, forecasting, have you worked cross-functionally? Can you take direction? Can you look outside the box, can I stand to talk to you for 30 minutes at a time?… I don’t need you to do anything else. You don’t need 8 certifications that say you might one day use your six sigma. Just fix my demand planning problem. Too many on this sub come here and ask if they can get a job with a doctorate in math and is it possible that a background at NASA is good enough to biuld power points all day.

        "content": "I am waiting for my new job to start and have too much time, so I have been on Reddit all day saying to use transferable skills. I think finance is actually a good background. If you dealt with P&L, that goes great with inventory - inventory turnover/holding costs/yada yada. Also, S&OP and AOP go hand in hand. Demand forecasting, inventory planning, etc.,  it ALL goes back to finance. You won't be starting at that high of a level, but you could probably throw it in somewhere in your job descriptions Use ChatGPT to help you translate your current background with jobs you might be looking at. Like... How does my experience from my resume (or you can just type paragraphs of what you've done) align with this job description. I did it for the role I finally got after three months of looking...  I used it more for my interview as well to explain, in person, how my skills related to the job. \n\nI say an MBA won't really help you here based on personal experience. I got an executive MBA for a few reasons, one of which was thinking it would make me more competitive. I think it did to an extent, but I already had several years of real world experience in what I was doing. I think it made more of a difference in getting into management roles or moving between industries (which I've done every job change). I think people it saw it as a \"we could promote her\" versus just a \"she will be great in this supply chain role because she has an MBA\". I think certifications and skills will mean more. Learning SQL and Excel are great! Any statistical skills? Great for analyst. If not, you can learn them. Udemy and Coursera are your friends. \n\nFYI - remote roles are EXTREMELY competitive. I have nearly ten years' supply chain experience, my MBA, and an undergrad from a pretty well recognized school and in my past few months of job hunting, I only had ... two interviews for remote roles. Remote work is shrinking and most remote roles that I have been seeing are high level or more technical analyst roles.",

    "content": "Here’s a brief overview of my background: I spent 17 years at a major U.S. railroad, starting in a warehouse for 2 years before moving to transportation. I worked as a train dispatcher for 10 years, overseeing freight and passenger train movements, then transitioned into management for 5 years, where I managed large projects like the East Side Access project in New York. My responsibilities included overseeing freight train crews, equipment, and materials, as well as coordinating meetings among various departments and maintaining records of equipment and materials nationwide. I’m now seeking a remote position, particularly in supply chain management, which seems to have many opportunities. I understand that these roles require knowledge of loads, containers, driver management, and teamwork. I’m interested in buyer positions and other roles that may be new to me. I would appreciate advice on bridging my railroad experience to a career in supply chain, including recommended courses or certifications, and whether I should consider entry-level positions for industry knowledge. Since leaving the railroad, I’ve focused on web development (I hold a degree in Computer Science), but I miss project management and teamwork. I hope to leverage my 17 years in transportation and project management in a similar role. Thank you for your time and any guidance you can offer.",

        "content": "I am not sure your location - I know some areas have more competitive job markets than others. If you're in a less competitive area, they'll be more likely to take people with transferable skills versus direct experience. The role I'm about to start doesn't really relate to what I have done in the past, but I have a lot of transferable skills. The talent pool out here is also pretty small. I think you have good experience, but it might be hard to translate it to companies when you're competing against a lot of highly qualified people. That being said... \n\nOne thing you can do is go through a recruiting firm that specializes in military.  I am a veteran who got a planner/scheduler role as my first job post-military. It gave me the foundation for everything else I've done. I went to a hiring conference through a military recruiting firm, so employers knew  we weren't necessarily going to have any \"real-world\" experience in that job. They weren't even specifically recruiting for that job, but the recruiter showed them my resume and they really liked what they saw. My undergrad was in psychology but I had IT experience which translated wonderfully into the machine scheduling piece. I did the officer thing after being enlisted, but they were more interested in my IT experience than my officer experience.\n\nAlso, if you haven't used them, Recruit Military and Hiring our Heroes have veteran specific hiring events. They have in-person and virtual. I've been unemployed a few months and have been using them. I didn't find my upcoming job through either method because I'm located in an area without many employers and remote roles are either a) super competitive, or b) didn't match my skillset. BUT, I made connections and have new people on my LinkedIn and people to e-mail when I apply to jobs at those companies. You can talk one on one with recruiters and hiring managers, so it will help get your name noticed if nothing else!",

    "content": "I found sharing this type of post helpful before the exam, as it eased my nervousness. I'll focus on my own experience. For the exam, I was allowed to bring water and my calculator, but the on-screen calculator was already a full scientific one. I didn't need them since I could do the few math questions in my head, despite not being great at it. I had to place other electronics in a locker, and bathroom breaks were relaxed—no need to raise my hand, as the proctor said, \"I'm not a monster.\" The exam took me about three hours, and the questions were quite similar to the CSCP practice tests on Udemy, minus the typos. Although I wasn't a fan of the Udemy tests, they were probably worth the $12 since I scored 80-90%. Most questions were one-liners, with about 60% categorized as \"easy,\" especially after practicing APICS quizzes. Around 10% were unexpected, while the rest were moderately difficult, and I felt mostly confident in my answers. Training myself to read each question carefully helped, as I often missed key words when rushing. \n\nI scheduled the test for early October, created a study plan, and then got bacterial pink eye, which limited my reading for two weeks. I studied intensively the last week or two, despite my still-impaired vision. My initial practice test score was 57%, which was slightly better than the pre-test but discouraging. It motivated me to review all questions with GPT for clarification before retaking it, achieving a 94% score—though I should have gotten 100% since it was the same questions. My average score on chapter/module quizzes was around 75%. I took notes on the 28 quizzes, revisited them, and sought GPT's help for consistent mistakes. After two rounds, I focused on the four quizzes where I scored below 70%. Fun fact: I started CSCP last year while working as a purchasing manager at a hotel and landed a job requiring the cert in June, which came with a 20% raise, partly due to what I learned. This is part of my transition from chef to supply chain management.",

Look up their turnover rate; they pay well because they are constantly replacing young people who cannot get out of there fast enough. I joined through their management training program with 11 other people in my region and after about 7 years all of us had left. I cannot give a stronger recommendation to look elsewhere for a full time career.",

Numbers, dims, names, suppliers pretty much on recall, assuming it's a reasonable number to remember.\n\nEdit: the ability to learn, make decisions on the fly and sort out issues before EOD is key. On top of this, knowing what the larger market is doing and how a product might need to be repositioned to better capture the target audience. A marketing degree is a step to it, but it's not the key. Experience is the key. \n\n\nI would suggest looking at account management roles as they will be easier to get interviews and then transition into category/product management.",

Much of what product managers do is working with many cross-functional teams to build the strategy, product development, design, marketing, getting field feedback from users/customers, and working with engineering/data science to develop and implement the product. Build up your soft skills. At least in my company, the lowest level for a PM is x3 and entry level is x1. They literally will not hire you as an x3 with little experience unless you have a masters and internship experience. Most x3’s that are hired straight from college actually had an internship in the company first and proved during their internship that they can be given any project and succeed in a short amount of time which built trust with the hiring managers. I myself came from a supply chain background and started in the company as x2 and worked my way up internally to eventually land a x4 product role. The space that I am in now has a lot to do with my previous SC background and that helped me thrive in my current role.",

I began in software but have shifted to heavier industries, specifically energy and now aviation. My role involves significant data analysis and operational improvements, including sales forecasting, fare loading, dashboard creation, sales performance analysis, process enhancement, tender sourcing, and various other tasks. While in university, I also did security and WHS site safety work in logistics and warehousing. One of my sales operations roles was at an EDI provider, and I have experience building an unsuccessful e-commerce store, which highlighted the logistical challenges of rapid scaling. I have used SAP for PO processing, Netsuite for sales orders, Salesforce, Power BI, Qliksense, PRISM, and Excel extensively. I recently completed a graduate certificate in data science, using R and Python, but I dislike it and lack the technical skills for advanced data science or AI.

I'm turning 33 soon, and following a major accident and hospitalization, I'm rethinking my career in analytics. I have six years of experience in sales and sales operations, analysis, and reporting, primarily in software, renewable energy, and aviation, but I haven't worked in supply chain. I transitioned from account management to reporting and analysis, gaining experience with various platforms like Excel, Salesforce, Power BI, SAP, Netsuite, PRISM, and Qliksense. I also handled tasks like bid management, tender sourcing, contract management, and process improvement. I recently completed a graduate diploma in data science, where I struggled with Python and R, but I passed with help from Google and ChatGPT. I've been wanting to shift to supply chain and logistics, believing my skills, especially in sales operations, would be valuable. However, I'm uncertain if it's worth moving away from analytics since I feel burnt out. My salary has been low, possibly due to my performance, and many analytical positions receive numerous applications, particularly the higher-paying ones. I’ve considered exploring more commercially focused areas like contracts, procurement, project management, and operations management, which still utilize data but emphasize a business perspective. I've looked into various courses for advancing in supply chain, including a Master's in Operations Management, an MBA in Supply Chain Management, and others. What do you think?",

We’re using Tableau for 5 years at our company and in last couple years I’ve seen a huge surge in PowerBI just because it seems more user friendly for both Ops and Analytics. I’ve only seen Python used a handful of times. SQL is definitely good to learn to build the data structure that goes into PowerBI but I’ve seen more data centralized teams being built to focus on that part and a lot of Data Analytics teams purely focus on creating analytics tools for end-users. I have been part of interviews for Analytics roles and there are times when they’ll ask questions like how would you write this query to find the data for your analysis, etc and sometimes it’s as easy as “our warehouses store data on a local time zone, how would you convert this over to UTC time zone?” I started as a supply chain analyst working on forecasting and replenishment and told my manager that I have an interest in analytics so they had some of my peers teach me Tableau and SQL and then gave me small projects to work on to learn and apply those skills. Eventually, I was able to focus primarily on data analytics and made the switch over to the tech band.",

Since the election, there have been complaints about upcoming tariffs, but my focus is on whether replacing all corporate taxes with import tariffs would allow companies that rely on imports to maintain similar price points. Specifically, what tariff percentage would likely result in a net-neutral impact on costs of goods sold, keeping end-user prices stable? My current view is that there will be considerable short to mid-term challenges with both taxes and tariffs, but potential long-term benefits if manufacturing returns domestically. However, I lack sufficient industry knowledge to understand the implications of a system with only tariffs and no taxes.",

So adding tariffs hurts the consumer, removing corporate taxes helps the business, and will hurt the consumer as well as the shortfall will be a burden on the tax payer.\n\nThe research I saw stated that this plan will cost the American taxpayer $5000 more per year.

Fashion retailers who want fixture scanning, certain industries that track parts this way like electric motors.  The problem is you just can't wire the entire warehouse with readers, so you see need some type of RF barcode or voice location control.  Tags are burned as part of the outbound process with the data coming from the WMS based on what was picked.\n\nThe industry is heading towards visual/virtual systems, not RFID.\n\nMy guess is you need more robust WMS or just transactional excellence, not new RFID tech.  I have done WMS implementations/sales/consulting for 16 years now.  I have yet to see an instance where inventory control can't be fixed by a Tier 1 system plus institutional controls (like not letting the sales guy just take stuff from the stacks).",

When I started working with it for supply chain (2004) it was billed as the answer to the barcode bottleneck - line of sight scanning requirements. It's taken a lot longer to mature and see broader adoption but it has improved significantly since those early days.\n\nPM if you want to discuss more.",

I've decided to pursue a career as an inventory specialist to move away from manual labor, as I prefer the structured nature of inventory management over managing people. This certification seemed like a way to transition to a more professional role and earn a better salary. However, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I researched options and chose CPIM since I don’t want to pursue a degree, but now I find the material daunting, as it feels more suited for someone with a degree in the field. I underestimated my knowledge and am questioning if this will truly help me enter the career I desire. Is it realistic to think I can succeed when I feel like a beginner in the terminology? UPDATE: I appreciate the unexpected support and encouragement. Thank you all for your kind words! I plan to study an hour daily, use pocket prep, and download Speechify.

Get a reading app to read the material to help review while you are commuting, doing chores or out for a walk.\n\nPocket Prep is a must. Get through all 1600 questions. Make a habit to do the *Question of Day* and *a Quick 10 Quiz* every morning. Spend some time reading the explanations. Ask ChatGPT about any questions that you struggle with.\n\nAs for the section quizzes don't worry about them the first time thru the material. They will be hard in the beginning because they just don't cover concepts in that section but cover things you haven't studied yet in future chapters. Just skim the section and look for key concepts then take the quiz before you read the section. This way you get a look at what you'll need to pay attention to in the section. After you read the section take the quiz again. Don't worry too much about the score the first time thru the material.  The second time thru the material try to get 80% on each section quiz.\n\nAfter this think about going to college. You'll be thankful later in life. If not just cert yourself up then. Every year aim for a new cert. At least with a CPIM, CSCP, LSSGB , PMP, CPF, CLTD, CSTC, MITx MM, DDMRP you might have a chance for better jobs later in life.\n\nPace yourself and relax. You got this! Good luck!",

You need to finish 5 courses and take final exam to receive the final certificate. But each course has its own exam, deadline and certificate. It is pretty intense.\n\nMy friend is working in procurement at a very large car manufacturer in Japan and I discussed with her often during the course.

    "content": "Hello everyone, I'm struggling to calculate delivery costs per delivery point in a Milk Run system. I have a cistern truck that delivers to 1 to 6 points per load, with various products and quantities. The truck charges me a per km and a daily rate. For km costs, I noted the odometer readings at departure, each delivery point, and arrival. For 3 Delivery Points (DP): DP 1's km cost is divided by 3; DP 2's cost includes DP1's km divided by 3 plus km from DP1 to DP2 divided by 2; DP 3's cost includes DP1's km divided by 3, DP1 to DP2's km divided by 2, and DP2 to DP3's km divided by 1. I'm unsure about dividing return km among the 3 DPs, so any suggestions would be appreciated. Each DP's costs are then averaged by the product quantities delivered, converting to €/kg. The km calculations seem mostly resolved, but I'm uncertain about the daily fixed cost. Often, the truck loads today and returns tomorrow after making those 3 DPs, and sometimes it delivers a partial load to a nearby customer before returning for a larger delivery. For this, I have a few ideas: calculate hourly costs based on the daily rate for the time spent from departure to return for each run; divide the fixed cost by the quantities delivered at each point as a weighted average (our previous method, but without km costs); or allocate the fixed cost like the km cost. I'm leaning towards calculating hourly costs for each run and then distributing this cost per DP, similar to the km method. Thank you for your assistance!",

I started in entry level operations, moved up to ops manager in a couple years, from there went into Account Management. Spent about 5 years in a key account management role, when I found out one of my customer’s contact was leaving. He mentioned they were hiring to back fill his spot, as a SCM. I applied and he mentioned it up the chain. I knew their business inside and out, and handled the overwhelming majority of their freight already. \n\nThey hired me, I spent around 4 years in that role, and then the company expanded, and I was offered a role as a Sr. Manager - Outbound Logistics. I took it, then after 3 years, my leader retired and recently I moved to his role as a Director, which is where I sit now. \n\nIt’s a smallish company, however the pay is great and the stress is low. There’s a real family vibe, and they let me take off early for things at my kid’s school, or come in late without any questions asked. Sort of a crazy way of climbing the ladder but, it goes to show there’s not one “good” path.",

        "content": "Well this is long because I’ve been interviewing for jobs and going back on everything I have done. So you get lots of details on my seven years of inventory management!\n\nNot sure what your supply chain background is, it’s good if you like data and analyzing it. Which I do. It’s the foundation for a lot of supply roles and it’s good to have an understanding of it. I hated the physical inventory piece - I’d rather just do the forecasting and planning piece. \n\n\nRoles were different but all had similar elements and concepts. In my last role I was officially in charge of inventory - it was part of my job title - Materials Planning and Inventory Manager. A lot of spreadsheets and reports. I tracked aging inventory, inventory turns/usage, inventory accuracy and our warehouse management. Made sure our planning team and production staff were actually USING the old material, so there was a lot of people influencing. Did a lot with physical inventory but I’m not sure every inventory manager role does that. Mine was onsite. So, I had to manage our cycle count process (rather, create it because there wasn’t one), make sure our inventory counts were accurate, and our material was where it was supposed to be. So I did a lot with setting up and managing our automated systems. I wasn’t there long enough to get a super strong grasp on all of the intricacies of that industry and those specific materials; unfortunately, we got acquired and I guess my role was redundant (I was scared from day one with my role being new),  but I was starting to take over certain product lines. I used history to manage our ordering patterns.. I had a LOT of SKUS to track - over 7000 to be exact. And it was over multiple facilities, so the physical inventory piece was really challenging. Multiple people managed each facility. I’m actually really glad I got laid off that role (aside for needing to find a new one… sigh). Physical inventory sucks. \n\n\nOther role, we didn’t have an inventory manager and my manager was the plant manager and not materials manager (we didn’t have one), but I did a lot of the same tasks as when I was an “official” inventory manager- I just got paid half as much. I was a production planner and then operations manager and it was just a part of my responsibility to manage. If I didn’t, we either didn’t have the right material or we were under/over our customer requirements. I didn’t have to report anything - that was our finance team since it directly impacts financial numbers. As a production planner, I was mainly responsible for raw materials and as an operations manager I was mostly responsible for finished goods. But I was doing both for most of my time there (some long days). Since sales provided the “forecast data” that I submitted, technically the next level set the actual material we were receiving (corporate master schedulers), but sales did a terrible job and we never got the right material - either too much or not enough - so I just pulled our historic data and fixed it myself before submitting it 🤣. Ultimately they had responsibility for customer communications, so if we had aging material because of them, I gave them the info and they had to talk to customers to see if they wouldn’t take it for something else. \n\nI set our inventory policies and made sure we were utilizing our inventory management software. On the manager side I was more worried about finished goods and getting inventory policies set for customers. \n\nThat’s an overview of what I did with inventory. It really is the backbone of all of it. Can’t do anything if you don’t have a product, either raw for production or the finished product that goes to the customer.",

There’s a lot of tech being built on traceability and there’s already a system in place for truckloads to focus on shipping products of similar temps to prevent cold chain non-compliance. It’s a huge issue revolving around food and safety and legal complications associated with it when things are out of temp being delivered to customers with visibly poor quality. These large companies have the financial infrastructure to build in-house so why wouldn’t they go that route. Amazon for instance building their own data warehouse and AWS when they were primarily just an online retailer. It’s better to have control within their own company and build innovation than to rely on third party companies.",

        "content": "Volume is critical for this kind of thing as this means the difference between actually having them manufactured as opposed to buying from stock/wholesalers. From UK manufacturers you will be unlikely to get less than 10k if not 20k needed to be manufactured. This might even take some negotiation. If you're not reaching that you will need to buy from stock or get from somewhere like China. Regardless of where you buy from 5k is generally the absolute cut off for manufacturing as opposed to buying from stock, and in that instance you may have a setup fee due to low volume.\n\n  \nFor a soft plastic bottle you need to have a material like LDPE or MDPE. It's possible that they can use moulds for HDPE and use a more flexible grade. LD = low density / MD = Medium denisity / HD = High density. You could arguably use PET but if you have used a heinz ketchup bottle before you will know that although they are squeezy, they don't squeeze well.\n\nFor manufacturers/stockists in the UK you could consider the following, I do have many more manufacturers and some links overseas,\n\nSMurray\n\nMasom Freer\n\nSpectra\n\nFor stock try Richmond containers, but there are many more.\n\n  \nIf you actually need assistance on developing something my job is literally a packaging consultant. I'm based in the UK and can assist with anything packaging related. There are many more bottles available around the world and one of the initial things I often do for brands is give them multiple options before leading the project of implementing it if they like something (and if they want me to help anyway). It's not always as straight forward as it should be to implement it properly, safely and on time. I can help with that,\n\n  \nHappy to answer more of your questions for free though.

I would appreciate your feedback on the software described below. Specifically, do you find it useful, and if so, why? \n\n**Description**  \nI'm developing software that enables freight forwarders to track the real-time GPS location of truckers transporting their shipments.\n\n**How it Works**  \nThe software includes a mobile app and a web portal.  \n1. The forwarder assigns a shipment to a trucker.  \n2. The driver downloads the mobile app on their phone.  \n3. The forwarder inputs shipment and driver details.  \n4. The software matches the shipment to the driver based on the entered information.  \n5. The driver receives a notification about the shipment, and tracking begins.  \n6. The forwarder is notified upon reaching milestones, such as pickup, halfway point, and delivery.  \n\nThe software requires the driver’s consent to track their location. I look forward to your thoughts. Thank you!",

I do manage shipping at my current job, but it's small packages that I process through UPS. Anyone have any advice for me about what I should know going in for the interview?

It doesn't make it impermeable to air, but it is an alternative to putting them in sachets before cartons.\n\nFor this there are a range of options in terms of carton box styles. Generally speaking these dielines are made with certain softwares that carton manufacturers have. You need the right software or generator to do it. There are hundreds anf thousands of designs out there but in your instance you need to determine what you want,\n\n1. tubular STYLE cartons - think of a regular 4 sided box that is long and tuck in panels at either side. \n\n2. Pillow style packs - These are not common for chocolote bars however it is possible to do long and thin versions of this with tight curves. \n\n3. tray style cartons with integrated or separate lids. \n\n4. Paper tubes - UK example is a company called visican. YOu would need to find someone local to you. \n\n5. Something more unique and shaped\n\nI'm a packaging developer now, but used to be a structural designer so I know all about how to make nets and the software used. If I were you go on packmage and get yourself a trial.. If you want more help feel free to DM me and I will answer questions in more depth.",

Many companies have 0 packaging engineers and want to hire 1 so there is nobody to teach you anything.   It can be a role you move into, or assume responsibility for without experience  from some adjacent manufacturing or logistics  role at some places, but a fresh hire at a new company they are looking for someone from one of the main schools of packaging.   Also it can be a remote role,  but only for an experienced packaging engineer who is good at CAD and doing their own design work, plus has some support on site.  As a fresh engineer who knows nothing not a chance, you need to interact with everything to learn.  Samples, testing , your going to have a desk full of boxes/inserts your working on, meeting with supplier etc.  Also you will be called to the floor to investigate any and all packaging issues.",

        "content": "Learn about the different types of boxes and how they are glued/assembled.\n\n\nGoogling different carton styles gave some good answers.\n\n\nPerhaps even download a trial of one of the softwares if possible. The different softwares used for carton construction are.\n\n\nArtiocad (most popular)\nEngview\nImpack\nKasemake\n\n\nMajor manufacturers are likely to use one of these.\n\n\nAlso check out ECMA (folding cartons) and FEFCO (corrugated). These are standards which includes many box styles. When designing something basic it's common to take a standard of a particular box and just change the dimensions and will change live in the software. These are generally the first point of call for many designs, that are then adapted accordingly for the product.\n\n\nThe CAD packages above often have these standards built into them. It's possible you could try getting a trial of packmage, which is a cheap less professional alternative of these CAD softwares. They may have these styles in them.\n\n\nAlso, might be worth to learn about flat bed cutters, the major companies that provide these are kongserg and Zund. If you are creating Carton profiles and need to test with the product you will be using one daily.\n\n\nAlmost make sure you know about board grades, GSM (board weight) or micron/ums). You may also consider the type of boards available in your market.\n\n\nYou may also want to consider:\n- grain direction \n- make ready times\n- print methods for the company or. Litho\n- diecutter\n- folding/gluing machines etc\n- tolerances.\n\n\nPhew. After all this I truly hope when you said structural is that it's actually based in the carton industry and not something like 3D glass or plastic.\n\n\nI was a packaging structural designer for 3 years in the UK for a large American manufacturer. I left many years ago and moved into packaging development. These days I work with all materials, not just board.\n\n\nGood luck. Feel free to message me if you have any more questions.",

For example if they're designing a brand new bottle shape vs a design application to an existing bottle: these are two very different skill sets and deliverables. \n\nI have experience working with internal and external teams as well as a mix. My previous years of experience was that large new designs were outsourced to a creative person or group and then executed internally and then maintained internally. The suppliers always did the engineering technical work etc.  my current experience is fortunate in that my team manages the external packaging design agency directly and owns the entire process. Marketing and internal creative do not have a say beyond launch timing and promotional execution of the product once it is developed by the product team on which we sit. I prefer this although it is rare. \n\nDealing with internal creative and marketing teams is a headache for \"service functions\" such as packaging folks in most industries because, as you mentioned, we are forced to have all the accountability but have zero actual power or decision making abilities. Unfortunately that's just how CPG works because everything is tied to sales and thus marketing drives decision making and creative is often controlled directly by marketing.",

If you are not familiar with equipment and materials, 4 full days is still probably 1-2 too many.",

As long as your label is designed well—clear, professional, and sticks securely—it can still work. Focus on quality materials for the bag itself and make sure the label communicates your brand’s vibe. A lot of small businesses start this way. Plus, as your business grows, you can always upgrade to printed packaging later. It might be worth comparing prices between [sticker labels](https://www.uprinting.com/stickers-and-labels.html) and [custom packaging](https://www.uprinting.com/packaging-printing.html) to make the best choice for now.",

Just don't use a sandwich bag as your base. Lol. \n\n\nHere's what I would do: \n\n\nStartup Stage:\n\n- Buy some coffee bags off Amazon or Uline (or from whatever local supply house near you). I would recommend a box bottom bag, as it looks more professional.\n\n- Have some high end clear PP labels printed with your brand. Don't go to your local print/copy shop. Use a reputable label printer. Many of them can run MOQ as low as 100 labels (though pricing is better at higher volumes). \n- Affix to bag. Look like a million bucks. \n\n\nGrowth Stage: \n\n- Once your quantities are a little higher, look at printing a generic branded bag, but leave space for a clear label if you're introducing new roasts. We can print branded bags as few as 1,000pcs on our digital printer. However, we recommend at least 5,000pcs in order for the unit pricing to make sense. \n\n\nChugging Along Stage: \n\n- If you have a few core roasts that have significant recurring volumes, go ahead and print them right onto the bag. I'd still leave a generic bag to label for your new/seasonal roasts. \n\nIf you're selling e-commerce, I think the better option is getting a good website. Once your customer buys/tries/likes your product, the packaging is less of a selling feature and is more of a vanity point - if they've already ordered your product without seeing the packaging, then they're interested in the product itself, not whatever the bag looks like. \n\n\nDM me if you have any questions.",

I've used bubble wrap, air pockets, and peanuts, but none worked. My only other choice is a larger box with additional packing, but that increases dim weights and nearly doubles my shipping costs. I believe formed foam would be ideal, but I can’t afford a costly system. I tried open cell spray foam insulation, which worked well, but its quick cure time means I constantly replace nozzles during shipping, sometimes even while packing. Any assistance would be appreciated.",

There’s no way to get around having to protect your product from shocks/impacts in the distribution system unfortunately.

Materials: Different packaging materials come with varying costs. 2. Finishes: The complexity of printing finishes greatly impacts pricing. 3. Customization: Unique design, printing technology, or structural requirements will affect the price. 4. Size and Structure: Generally, larger boxes with complex structures cost more due to processing and finishing. 5. Quantity: Larger order quantities usually lead to lower unit prices. 6. Design Fees: If professional design services are needed, this will add to the cost. Does anyone know if there are additional factors to consider? I need to budget for the price. Thank you.

Shipping from localized suppliers can keep your costs down and allow them to react more quickly, should you need them to. Consolidation of box sizes will also help reduce cost and increase your buying power. When it comes to corrugated boxes, many companies don’t have their products tested to ensure they’re using the correct ECT. Flutes in the walls of the boxes dramatically change pricing.  Good suppliers will work closely with you to ensure you are utilizing the best options. Good luck and check at least 3 sources.",

For folding cartons there is offset and digital. For corrugated there’s flexo and digital. The offset and flexo printing usually has higher quality results and the digital usually allows for lower volume. The number of colors used to design your artwork comes into play and you would either use cmyk or spot colors. All of this affects pricing. After the print, finish is applied and then that factors in, too. \n\nThe more machines required in your process will be higher costs. \nIn folding cartons your standard set of machines is:\nPre-press print plates and layout plus wooden diecut tool making\nPress machine\nIf not in-line, then a finishing machine like UV, foil or embossing\nDiecut machine\nAfter diecut it goes to a waste removal process to remove the boxes from the excess paper of the sheet\nGlue machine",

        "content": "Shibidishoob gave a great answer and would refer to that first. It seems we both had a background in this area.\n\n\nBut in short and if I might add, for folding carton construction/shape only where gluing is basic, think straight lines, this is where the cost is lower and make ready times, the time to setup the machine, is reduced. When you have complex angles (tapered boxes) or auto lock/crash lock bases more money will be applied to the setup.\n\n\nThis will generally not be such an issue if you buy a higher quantity where the print time is much longer than setup.\n\n\nBesides the more use of graphical printing processes or finishing effects quantity aside the board/material is a major part of the unit cost. Though\n\n\nThe number of processes will probably increase the tooling and unit costs if you need dies.\n\n\nFinally, the only other thing I would mention is packing. If you're creating the overal cost of good, for the box you may need to determine the labour cost needed to fill it. Where you have inserts or complex boxes the time and cost to pack cab increase substantially. But, say you saved money on the box and opted to go for a cheaper envelope base carton (more manual) over a autolock or crash lock  base carton (quicker to assemble), the money saved on the box may now simply be moved to a higher labour cost.

Heavier or fragile items usually need sturdy materials like corrugated cardboard, while lighter stuff can work with paperboard or chipboard.\n2. **Material**: If you're looking for eco-friendly options, kraft paper or biodegradable materials are great. For a premium touch, rigid boxes are a sleek option.\n3. **Box Size**: Make sure the box fits your product well to avoid using too much filler and to save on shipping costs.\n4. **Budget**: Balance between protecting your product and keeping costs reasonable.\n\nAlso, consider customization—printing your logo or adding special finishes can give your packaging a polished, branded look. Plus, eco-friendly packaging is a big win with consumers these days!\n\nIf you're interested in a deeper dive, this guide breaks it all down: [The Ultimate Guide to Packaging](https://www.uprinting.com/ultimate-guide-to-packaging.html).

Custom packaging means custom tools which means custom money. Keep in mind everytime the package is touched in manufacturing it adds cost, CMYK printing, Spot colors, foil, texture, coating, emboss/deboss, etc. \n\nMy brother majored in packaging science at RIT. They have a great testing lab there that you could potentially reach out to if you are on a very low budget. Customer experience is very important, but outside of the wow factor it’s even more important that your product arrives undamaged (if your shipping) ship testing is real. So is temperature, pressure, etc.",

    "content": "I've been in the packaging industry for over 35 years, and one of the most frequent questions I receive is about packaging. This lengthy post offers valuable insights, particularly on flexible packaging, which is the most recognized form. Flexible packaging includes items like pouches, bags, and plastic wraps, unlike rigid options such as bottles and boxes. \n\nI'll discuss the pouch, a popular item found globally, without delving into material structures. Here's a brief overview of the process for procuring flexible packaging from both the customer's and supplier's perspectives. When small brands seek packaging, they contact suppliers. Customers typically request pouches that stand up on shelves and feature recloseable zippers. Suppliers inquire about the application and size, which new brands often overlook. If the customer is unsure, they need to consider factors like product size, shelf life, display needs, opening methods, quantity, and design readiness. \n\nSuppliers provide options, some able to deliver quickly but at a higher cost, while many require minimum orders of 5,000 to 10,000 pouches. Short runs are mainly produced through digital printing, with the HP Indigo press being the most common, costing around $1.25 million. Pricing depends on footage and equipment efficiency rather than just the number of pouches. For instance, a 4” x 6” pouch requires 15” of film when laid flat. If the pouch height increases, efficiency decreases, leading to more waste.\n\nOnce printed, suppliers laminate the film to enhance strength and barrier properties. The film is then processed into pouches via custom machines that fold and seal the film, incorporating zippers and tear notches before final cuts and quality checks. \n\nFor a 5,000 pouch order, the manufacturer uses approximately 833-950 feet of film, costing between $0.75 and $1.25 per pouch. Digital printing allows for flexibility with multiple designs for different SKUs without changing the price significantly. As volume increases, pricing decreases. If you eventually need 50,000 pouches with various SKUs, you'll see considerable benefits.\n\nNew or growing brands should consider digital short-run pouches and budget accordingly, avoiding the pitfalls of imports. American-made pouches often provide better quality and communication with suppliers. Patience is crucial; allow time for design and request a dieline for proper artwork layout. Suppliers need vector-ready files, and working with a packaging designer is advisable to avoid potential issues.\n\nThe entire process can take 6-",

I would argue at pouches at $1.50 or higher are quite expensive for a brand just starting out, as in my experience pouches contain reasonably inexpensive goods.\n\n\nI've been trying to find methods to get packaging (other than pouches) at very low quantities as most of the companies I work with a small just starting out. I generally advise them don't worry about getting a nice pouch printed, but something off the shelf and customise it with labels etc giving more attention to the labour.

Granted, a skilled designer can remove them, but it’s not worth it for them to do so. \n\nIf the customer is new and their credit is strong, there’s normally no charge for samples. Most companies can create a couple of samples from sheets for testing and qualification. \n\nSome companies will ask for a a deposit and credit that deposit back upon receipt of the PO. \n\nI’ve owned and run many packaging companies over the past 30 years and I’ve alway done die lines and samples for qualified customers. Never ever send over vector artwork to a customer and if you charge them for it, they have legal right to all the files. Thus the charge but no payment and the credit on the first order over x amount. \n\nIf a customer is serious about your work, they’ll understand the down payment invoice which will become payable if the PO is not received in x days from approvals. \n\nThis protects you and the customer. \n\nPutting these notes in the quote to the customer is also important. It provides a clear pathway to the final product and holds everyone accountable. Setting clear expectations up front is the key to success when dealing with new clients who don’t fully understand the packaging process, start to finish.",

Luxury dealerships treat their consumers like royalty. From the initial introduction to the follow up after the purchase. \n\nSkincare products speak to consumers in the same manner. Premium packaging builds an emotional connection with consumers and sets the tone for the rest of the buying and use experience. Some well known brands have slightly scaled back on their packaging elegance, but their established well known brands. They also build an emotional connection with consumers through effective marketing.",

One thing to consider is that it’s not really a commoditized market where a consumer knows exactly what they’re buying. It’s a bit of a magic formulation - even if the ingredients are the same as another product, who knows the quality or quantity, or mfg process involved? People gravitate towards brands they know or trust. The brand carries meaning and value. And when you trust a firm in this way, they also ensure a good overall experience - if they didn’t cut corners on the 50 other components, why would they on packaging? Packaging also helps protect the product on a shelf and deliver a good experience when the customer uses it.\n\nI think packaging is very valuable in these products.",

I give them sustainable options to give them a choice but weight which portrays luxury or other luxury elements like foil can be very important for many brands.\n\n\nThere's glass and plastic that deliberately thick to give additional weight, there's even some makeup components that have added materials, sometimes metal deliberately to add weight.\n\n\nIf you want to be sustainable and luxury consider aluminum or glass. Thick heavy plastic, particularly clear plastic jars are generally not sustainable at all if this is of value to you. The trick is to be creative in terms of weight, materials, and artwork (generally being minimalistic).\n\n\n\n\nYou can also consider your secondary packaging (the cartons/boxes) you put them in as this can give the premiumisation with less impact on sustainability. Think shape, construction ,board weight, or other things. The shape of the boxes can give you standout appeal while using basic/off the shelves bottles/jar etc. Save money on the primary packaging but consider spending more on the secondary.\n\n\n\nHappy to give you some pointers or answer questions you may have. If you want actual more in depth help I do have some availability since it's my job :). Feel free to message me privately.",

        "content": "Ensure you know what you want to achieve with this as packaging like other areas is a mixed field. \n\n\nI started off sort of as a packaging engineer having studied packaging and graphic design at university. I designed carton dielines at a carton manufacturer but it didn't satisfy my need or pay me enough, though it gave me an important initial technical understanding. Design in my experience doesn't pay much, at least initially, but  I will add the US tends to give a higher value to packaging professionals that other markets so my experience probably is not the same with anyone.\n\n\nI went back to university and concentrated on packaging development and got a job in this position at a brand, not a packaging manufacturer.Basically although I can influence design I was the middle man between marketing, suppliers, designers as part of the NPD team and am effectively a packaging project manager and the leader of anything packaging related when I became a packaging development manager. \n\n\nTo answer your question more directly, your experience would probably work well in areas moulding plastic, glass or metal packaging where you can analyse the use of materials, the stresses, flow rates and sealing etc. This is probably more focused at a manufacturer that offers custom packaging developments. For a jump and if you have some money it might be worth looking into the institute of packaging course/IOP. Etc. in the UK at least this is less than £4k and the US has something similar. It can be done in a week but would definitely give you a jump that would be appealing to employers. It would give you sufficient packaging knowledge particularly when you think that around the world packaging education is quite limited.",

Unfortunately, most US packaging suppliers haven't recovered since Covid.  They need help finding workers, aren't fully staffed, can't find workers to pass a drug test, etc.  Material quality has plummeted, customer service is unheard of these days (unless you like Push 1 for Sales, 2 for Customer Service, 3...) and no one really cares.   Look to Specialized Packaging...hard to solve packaging (Aseptic, Retort, High Temperature, engineered barrier film...etc).  The current suppliers of these packaging items are horrible...really horrible (short shipments, delays, 16 week on up lead times...etc).  Consider finding factories that can supply packaging they are having problems with and your sales will skyrocket.

Someone else commented correctly that it sounds like a Packaging technologist role who applies a basic understanding of all disciplines of packaging (ideation, development, prototyping, testing, implementation, sustaining, etc)\n\nIf you can't find a local university and don't want to locate, I'd recommend pursuing a mechanical engineering role. At least in my experience, many similar processes and tools from ME can carry over to packaging. ME also will be a bit more intensive than a PE degree would offer, so you would see things get easier when you switch to a packaging career.\n\nIf you can't get a packaging degree, I'd suggest trying to get into a packaging company under an ME role so you can both work hands on around packaging to learn more, and be able to add it to your resume to make you more appealing for a packaging role without a packaging degree.\n\nUniversities are limited with packaging education, so it's not uncommon for people to be in packaging without going to school for it.",

Once you know what kind of “packaging engineer” you want to be, it’ll be easier to find a path. \n\nSome packaging engineers don’t design packaging, while for others that’s a good chunk of their responsibility. If you want to do more “design” focused engineering I would say you don’t need to pursuit an engineering degree. However, if you want to focus on the equipment, material testing, line trials, medical device or pharmaceutical industries etc. that generally requires a science or engineering degree. \n\nFor reference, I am a structural designer and the work I do is often referred to as “engineering” because it involves knowledge of materials, manufacturing processes, machinery and some basic math skills. You could copy and paste my job description and it would be almost identical to another company’s “packaging engineer” position. However, since I have a design degree (and experience), there’s a ton of “Packaging Engineer” jobs where I won’t meet 10% of their requirements. \n\nAlso I’m speaking from the viewpoint of working in the US. Things might be different in Europe. ",

        "content": "Look for IOP or IOPP and consider doing the course. Unfortunately you might need some degree of education to get into it and then a junior position. Businesses have a very different opinion of how specialised packaging employees need to be and one packaging engineer in cartons is very different for packaging engineers in plastics/glass etc. It's then very different if you work at a manufacturer as opposed to a retail brand.\n\nFor some companies packaging development is basic and requires some degree of packaging administration,  but for others it's much more advanced and more technical and experience is definitely needed. \n\nFor example I started as a Packaging design engineer in cartons (studied Packaging Design originally) and used to design box templates at a manufacturer. I then did a masters degree covering NPD and packaging development as I didn't want to be in the design space. Got a junior packaging development role, spent about 9 years as a packaging developer/packaging technologist (3 years at 3 brands), moved upto a Packaging Development Manager, and now a packaging consultant, generally specialising in all things cosmetics. Although I could work in food, I can expect that food would be a different ball game in some respect depending on the kind of food being sold.\n\nI don't really design these days, I more act as a technical expert, taking a brief or design concept for cosmetic brands and make it practical/feasible by working with my supplier network. I source/locate all kind of packaging options anything from bottles, jars, tubes, boxes, makeup packaging and more. Create timelines, review technical drawings, and act as the point of contact on all things packaging for brands (marketing, NPD, supply chain, founders etc) and packaging suppliers.\n\nThe packaging course is IOP/IOPP is definitely sufficient to get you into the game without spending big big money or years doing a degree, but then you need someone to give you an opportunity.   \nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

I doubt that some worker would spend his time making perfect strips with a paper knife. It's just not worth the time which you can spend doing your normal job.\n\nYou can make perforated strips to tear them easily, but that means that your packaging can tear apart during shipping, so it would not work as a packaging. Plus you will have increased production costs due to more complicated production tools and etc.\n\nWhy not just recycle?",

        "content": "For tracking quotes and managing inventory with complex variables like MOQs and price changes by quantity, Invoice Master might be worth considering. It’s designed to help businesses manage inventory, vendor details, and pricing in a more structured way than Excel. You can set up each part with vendor-specific information, track changes in pricing, and organize quotes by date, streamlining what sounds like a complex process. It also allows you to generate reports, which can give you insights into purchasing trends or help you quickly reference historical quotes without sorting through multiple Excel tables. You can start with the free tier to test it out and see if it fits your needs before committing.",

This is my first warehouse job; I started as a night loader in 2020. From day one, I’ve faced significant stress and problems that exceed my experience level. We handle soda, tea, water, beer, and wine, and the racking is not suited for the pallet sizes we use, causing substantial damage. Many racks lack guards, and there are dents at the bottoms, risking bolt failures. Additionally, many racks are missing anchors, and most are warped. Only 1 or 2 out of 20 aisles are straight enough to pass a string test. The narrow layout and back-to-back racking lead to collisions when using our standup lift, limiting our ability to maneuver. We can't sideload because the clearance is too short, and support beams obstruct some aisles. I need to replace and possibly reanchor some racking, but there are long rows that could stock 40 pallets each. Our fire suppression system is also affected, and I received conflicting advice on how to handle it. My supervisor suggested replacing it gradually, but this is a major project that could take months without halting operations. If OSHA inspected, they would likely shut us down, as the racking poses a significant danger to my team. I care about everyone's safety and would consider reporting to OSHA if necessary. Sorry for the lengthy message; I can provide more details if needed.",

Then they can work through a plan with you on how to address and start with high risk items. Deflection on the beams in a warehouse is normal to some extent. The beams do give slightly, but again an expert will be able to tell you if you are within spec. If you have some heavier pallets of goods you should probably ensure the racks are rated for them. If not, you could direct with WMS or manually with your team that those pallets must be stored on the A level/floor locations within your rack. Unfortunately what you are dealing with is pretty standard for taking over a warehouse. If the previous regime looked the other way and did not address it typically just continues to get worse over time.",

They won’t pay to replace all of it, but that’s something they must budget in the future.  So look for them to give you like 10k a year to fix racking, and then replace the worst until it gets better.  I was in a similar situation and it took 6 years at 15k a year but we got all of the bad spots fixed.\n\nAs far as the fire suppression, there are usually companies that install, service, and maintain those systems.  I know our system was inspected and tested once a quarter, and anytime we had issues we would talk to them. So someone must be maintaining that system, and that company would be the best place to start.",

This approach will help you manage the current inventory smoothly, support the new storefront launch, and set them up for future growth!\n\n1. **Start with a cloud-based WMS:** You can go for a user-friendly, cloud-based Warehouse Management System (WMS) that’s easy to access from multiple devices. Cloud options are often simpler to set up and maintain- this is ideal for anyone new to warehouse management.\n2. **Use barcode scanning:** It’s great that you want to use vendor barcodes! Many modern WMS solutions let you scan barcodes with a smartphone, so there’s no need to invest in extra equipment.\n3. **Focus on basic inventory tracking:** Start with the essentials like inventory counting, item locations, and simple order fulfillment. This will make it easier to manage items moving between the warehouse and the new storefront.\n4. **Catalog your existing inventory:** With a large inventory backlog, it’s worth organizing a thorough inventory count, even though it might take some time. \n5. **Look for mobile app support:** Choose a WMS that includes a mobile app. Scan items easily and get real-time updates as products move in and out.\n6. **Plan for growth:** While a basic setup is good to start, pick a system that can grow with the business—especially if you’re planning to open a storefront.",

        "content": "Starting warehouse management from scratch can feel overwhelming, especially with years of inventory to handle! Given your needs, here are some suggestions to help you set up a system that’s easy to manage and adaptable as your business grows:\n\n1. **Inventory Management Software**: Since user-friendliness is important, look into no-code platforms like **AppSheet**. I’ve built similar systems for warehouse and inventory management, and AppSheet could be a great fit since it allows you to create custom applications without coding experience. You can easily set it up to track inventory by SKU, manage in/out transactions, and even integrate barcode scanning using your vendors’ barcodes.\n2. **Getting Started with Barcoding**: Since you’ll be using existing barcodes, look for software that supports barcode scanning natively or can integrate with mobile devices. AppSheet, for instance, has barcode scanning functionality, so you won’t need to re-tag each item.\n3. **Streamlining Inventory Setup**: Since you have a large backlog of products, it might be helpful to start with a phased approach—prioritize high-demand items or newer stock to get started. You can tackle the older items gradually as time allows. For your initial setup, you could also consider hiring a temporary helper for data entry, especially if you have hundreds of SKUs to catalog.\n4. **Tracking Inventory Across Locations**: Since you’ll soon have both a warehouse and storefront, having a system with location tracking will help keep tabs on stock across multiple locations and prevent overselling. Look for software that lets you label or categorize items by location.\n\nIf you’d like to explore the AppSheet approach, I’d be happy to share more details on setting up barcode tracking or inventory control. Wishing you all the best as you set up this new system!",

    "content": "As businesses expand, selecting the right software becomes crucial, particularly between Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). The key question is which to implement first: CRM or WMS? To decide, it's important to evaluate the benefits, challenges, and operational needs. \n\n**CRM vs. WMS: Key Differences and Benefits**  \n1. **CRM Benefits:** Salesforce data shows that CRM users experience a 29% boost in sales productivity. Forrester's study finds that 73% of companies regard CRM as vital for meeting customer experience goals.  \n2. **WMS Benefits:** Implementing a WMS can cut warehouse operations time significantly (2-6 times), with integrated order processing leading to a 25% productivity increase, 20% better space utilization, and 30% improved stock efficiency.\n\nPrioritizing a CRM system is advisable for enhancing sales and customer management. While a CRM streamlines sales and improves customer service, efficient warehouse operations are equally essential for timely service. \n\n**Evolving Solutions: From Basic Tools to Advanced Technology**  \nIf budget constraints limit immediate investment in a complete WMS, starting with basic inventory tracking tools like Excel can be an option. However, this method is prone to manual entry errors. As your business grows, automating processes becomes necessary. Utilizing barcode scanners and mobile devices can centralize data and boost efficiency. While handheld scanners using Excel have limitations, a system allowing multiple simultaneous scans can enhance workflow significantly.\n\n**CRM for Sales is as Essential as Cleverence for Warehouse Management**  \nIn sales, inefficient systems lead to frustration and reduced productivity. A well-automated CRM helps sales managers focus on selling rather than manual data entry. In warehouse management, relying on manual data entry can compromise data accuracy and visibility. A robust WMS should automate processes and integrate with ERP systems for real-time inventory insights.\n\n**Why CRM Comes First and WMS Follows**  \nInitially, a CRM is critical for nurturing customer relationships and driving sales. With a solid CRM foundation, you can then enhance warehouse efficiency. While traditional WMS solutions are effective, they can be costly and time-consuming to implement. Opting for a flexible, affordable solution like Cleverence allows for quicker implementation and better stock visibility without the expenses of conventional WMS. By implementing a CRM first and then adopting a system like Cleverence, you can manage both customer relationships and warehouse operations effectively.",

    "content": "Hello, we have a small warehouse for stock related to upcoming jobs, managed by one warehouse staff member. When equipment arrives, he retrieves a job folder, marks the delivered items on the quote, and labels each box with the quote number and job name. These items are then stored on shelves categorized by client. On installation day, our technicians collect the items marked for that job. This system has worked until now, but we have larger jobs requiring pallets of equipment for our audio-visual installations. We have reorganized our warehouse into bays (dexion) instead of simple A to Z shelves. We want to implement the following: 1. A system where incoming items can be logged by opening the quote, assigning a barcode, printing it, and scanning the item to mark it as received. Each quote can then be assigned to a specific bay (A, B, or C). We currently use Xero and can manually add quotes or items. 2. A floor plan layout accessible to the sales team, allowing them to hover over bay sections to see information like \"Bay contains quote 1234 - This client,\" possibly via an internal webpage or API displayed on an office screen. 3. The warehouse staff can prepare the gear by placing all outgoing items in a designated area and scanning them out as dispatched. Installers can then pick up all necessary items for the job. Does such an application exist? I'm looking for suggestions. I found some software called RightControl Lite but can't locate the developer's site, only third-party download links.

They are relatively affordable WMS and offer customization and a good onboarding service to set you off on a solid foundation. \n\nI've been in 3pl warehousing for 30 yrs and we've used everything from really expensive admin heavy systems to in house custom built applications.  Unless you have staff IT that can manage custom apps i would go with these WMS providers that are geared toward small to medium size businesses.  \n\nWhere you will potentially spend unnecessary money is trying to get that top view visual component. It's going to cost more than it's worth imo. Just create a map of the facility with your locations and have visual markings for all bin/bulk locations. Eventually the layout will be 2nd nature and a standard report be just as effective as your wms giving you some kind of top down visual representation. \n\nThere are multiple receiving processes but it sounds like you just need a basic license plate protocol where you assign PIDs (pallet id's or CIDs if you want to tag at the carton level) to each pallet and then associate those PIDs with a specific job or quote and then marry them to a location.  When it's time to pull the order you print a pick ticket, scan the pids as picked and staged in a staging location. Then scan them out for delivery when they leave. Your WMS will track the current status of each PID and can give you real time visibility of everything you have. \n\nAdded benefits are cycle count programs and inventory management processes that allows for self auditing to confirm all counts and locations. \n\nYou can make it as complicated as you want but essentially a good label printer (Zebra) and a cloud based WMS with some Android scanners off Amazon and you can manage anything you are describing here.",

At any given time, it gives instantaneous visibility for the sales and the tech teams with what exactly is in each bay, all shown with a customizable visual floor plan.

This means you can set up internal screens or a server webpage to show inventory of each bay by client or job, enhancing communication and coordination.

We use several 203dpi Printonix T6204 printers with an inline barcode verifier that checks the barcodes on 4x6 labels for readability and breaks. These labels are for customer shipping. While we believe the barcodes are generally sufficient to prevent chargebacks, we do encounter some cases where automated systems struggle to read them completely, resulting in occasional chargebacks. We haven't received any evidence regarding label quality, and chargebacks are infrequent. However, we were warned that too many unreadable labels could lead to chargebacks for the entire order, regardless of what passes. We want to establish proof of label quality when they leave our warehouse to better contest chargebacks. I'm unsure how to find vendors that can integrate with our setup. Ideally, we seek a solution that grades the labels, reprints them if they fail, and maintains a record of their appearance at printing. Thank you for any suggestions.",

Instead of crossing your fingers and hoping it’s readable, you’ll know right from the start that each barcode is crystal clear and scuff-free.\n2. **Automatic Reprints for the Tough Cases**: Got a label that doesn’t make the cut? PackageX can be set up to automatically reprint any label that’s not up to snuff. No more worrying if one slipped through with a faint barcode; it’ll only send out labels that can stand up to even the strictest scanners.\n3. **Backup for Fighting Chargebacks**: And here’s the cherry on top—PackageX can store a snapshot of every label. So, if there’s ever a chargeback threat, you have proof of exactly what that label looked like when it left your place. It’s basically a digital backup to keep you covered.\n4. **Fits Right in With Your Current Setup**: No need to toss out the tech you already use. PackageX’s system can work with all kinds of setups, so it’ll likely fit in smoothly with your Printonix T6204s.\n\nAll in all, if you want a smoother shipping process and solid protection against chargebacks, PackageX can handle it! It’s like having a watchful eye over every label you send out, and that extra assurance can make a big difference.",

Pay is very competitive especially if using staffing companies or temps and sometimes based on geography it can be hard to explain to someone making pay decisions in a low wage market (like Texas).\n\nJobs in warehousing have become the go-to low skill entry level job. Just my opinion, but I see a lot of people who would have taken the 'go flip burgers' jobs showing up in warehousing.  Nothing wrong with that but part of the risk if you use temps.\n\nIf your company is not willing to pay for top talent you will have a hard time competing for the best team members.\n\nIt is critical to have software and warehouse systems that are easy to follow and understand.",

Those familiar with this type of scanner know the interface is poor and not user-friendly. I'm seeking a barcode scanner that transmits data via Bluetooth and includes a few buttons to send keypress events to the computer. My goal is to develop a program controllable by these buttons, allowing stockroom employees to interact entirely through the scanner with just a monitor. Does anyone know of a scanner that meets these requirements? I've found some scanners with keypads, but they seem limited to controlling onboard functions and can't communicate with connected devices.",

It's been on Facebook Marketplace for six months, and I’ve also had Prologis attempt to sell it and contacted every local reseller, but there’s been little interest. Any inquiries I received did not result in a sale. My lease ended in April, but Prologis let me keep it on-site while we tried to sell it.

    "content": "I'm currently interning at a medium-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on their Warehouse Management System (WMS). While I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS can improve our chaotic warehouse, where items frequently go missing and processes are outdated. We have two warehouse employees and storage for about 1,900 pallets. I believe implementing barcode labeling and scanners, along with organizing the warehouse by SKUs, will enhance control over inventory. The company needs insights into product locations for better order picking and putaway, as well as data to optimize procurement, since many old items linger in storage. Currently, only two suppliers provide compatible barcodes, complicating inventory accuracy. Integration concerns with our existing ERP system, Exact Globe+, have led vendors to quote implementation costs between thousands to over 10,000 euros. I'm uncertain if implementation is necessary, as one vendor suggested using CVC files and an FTP server, which is outside my expertise. I'm also considering if a standalone WMS might be better. While WMS can improve inventory accuracy, it doesn't align well with our current practices, which involve writing off used goods during production. Our open warehouse policy leads to discrepancies due to items being taken freely. We don’t need all WMS features but want better control over our goods and procurement information. I'm unsure if barcode quality can be improved with printers and scanners, as we currently have only one scanner compatible with two suppliers. I see potential in a WMS solution, but I’m concerned about compatibility with our processes and the high costs involved, especially since the company has fewer than 100 employees. I'm seeking guidance to navigate this complex situation.",

        "content": "2000 pallets is probably manageable without a wms (not saying that one wouldn't be helpful of course)... depending on complexity of SKUs.. How many SKUs?\n\nFirst thing is that they would need to let go of their current way of doing things if they got a wms. 2 reasons. 1. If you keep doing things essentially the same way,  you probably aren't really improving,  so it will be extra work for little benefit . 2. Customising a WMS to act how you want it is expensive (for people who have many more than 2 warehouse employees).\n\nWith WMS you want to match the complexity to your business needs. Manhattan,  SAP EWM etc might be good, but they aren't for you . You will want some sort of SAAS. \n\nWith respect to cost. $10 000  is basically no money at all. If they aren't willing to spend it, they aren't nearly committed enough.  Similar deal with barcode scanners (which incidentally can usually be configured to read different barcode types). If they aren't willing to buy new devices,  they aren't committed enough. \n\nI'd feel out their level of commitment  before checking out SAAS WMS systems.  Do they have a budget in mind? \n\nMight be worth considering what other options you could have to manage the situation without a WMS. ERPs should help with stock planning.  Kanban might work for some items?\n\nFor storage management, a classic strategy is to have a prime/fixed/pick bin for each SKU (laid out so you can find it somehow), then any time you have extra stock that doesn't fit there you write its location number,  quantity and date on a little card that sits it a sleeve on the upright of the pick bin...If you need an item you only have to go to its pick bin, and you can see the list of everywhere that item is. You could do this without any software at all.  Maybe they need discipline more than they need a WMS?\n\nAnyway,  some considerations.",

I'm looking to establish a standard convention for our warehouse SKUs. We have unique 'model numbers' for our products, which can also include an additional detail/descriptor (e.g., model number + attribute 1 or attribute 2). Is it a mistake to use model numbers as SKUs?",

However, now having a college degree is almost mandatory for any level above an operations supervisor.\n\nDefinitely continue your education and, most importantly, become an absolute ninja when it comes to microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. \n\nDon't wing it in college, and use your time there to really get good at data analysis, and you are set for life !\n\nAll the best !",

As a senior in my final semester at a top SCM university, with a prior internship at General Motors in Global Supply Chain, I've applied to over 100 job postings, both locally and across the US, yet haven't received any interview offers. Many applications to companies like Honeywell, Kimberly-Clark, and Bechtel Corporation have gone without updates for nearly two months. I feel lost lately, as it seems I'm just sending out applications without any feedback. I've reached out to recruiters and employees at these companies to network, but I often get no response. Why be a recruiter if you don’t engage with potential candidates? I know many share my experience, but I would appreciate any advice or insights anyone might have.",

Few tips off the top of my head:\n\n- show off numbers on it wherever you can\n- keep format simple\n- use action words to show what you’ve driven\n- leave it in word doc format so algorithms can get it through the initial screening \n- ensure you show off that gps as it’s impressive \n- toss jobs req’s you want into worditout.com. Paste in the job posting —> it’ll show you most used words —> plug those into your resume so algorithms have a higher shot of getting your resume to a recruiter \n- find your local ASCM or CSCMP chapter. Great networking opportunity and many local opportunities may arise from them\n\nBest of luck!",

Specifically, I'm exploring whether the trend of consumers choosing low-cost sites like Shein and Temu is affecting unethical practices in other organizations. I'm unsure which professions to target for my inquiries, so any guidance would be appreciated. If you have relevant experience, feel free to message me privately and perhaps participate in a survey (I know it's tedious, but I really need respondents). All responses will be anonymous.

    "content": "Is it too late to start a career in Supply Chain? I’m seeking advice on switching careers and whether pursuing a graduate certificate or certifications like CPIM/CSCP is worthwhile. I live in Portland.  \n\nBackstory: In high school, I participated in a work-study program with internships and spent nearly three years at a global logistics company, where I found the data entry work unfulfilling. During my senior year, I interned in materials planning at an automotive manufacturer, but I felt lost as graduation approached. I chose to major in marketing, thinking it would lead to exciting opportunities at companies like Nike, but now I’m struggling financially while my tech friends are buying homes. \n\nAfter a year of reflection, I see no future in marketing. I currently enjoy a secure administrative job but want to engage my mind and earn more. I even returned part-time to my logistics job during college but messed it up during COVID and lost that opportunity. \n\nNow, I’m exploring supply chain roles and realize they might suit me, as I enjoy data analysis, problem-solving, and efficiency. I’m learning SQL and improving my Excel skills, which I believe would be beneficial in this field. The analytical aspect of supply chain excites me, and I feel it would align my skills with my interests. However, I’m uncertain if it’s too late to transition and if investing in certifications is a good idea. Any advice on whether supply chain would be a good fit or if these certifications are worth the investment would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

If it is needed operations experience is also great to have on the resume. \n\nHaving SQL knowledge is also good so you can show yourself as able to talk IT as well as business. \n\nGood luck!

Most likely a bottom draw via an adjustable slide gate or orifice plate, but could also be vertical auger or dense phase. \n\nMy suggestion is to get off your ass and do a site visit.

    "content": "Recent changes to Section 321 of the U.S. Tariff Act, which exempts low-value shipments from duties, have increased scrutiny on platforms like Shein and Temu. The U.S. government is tightening this rule to address the de minimis loophole that permits these companies to ship goods duty-free to American consumers. Understanding the broader context of U.S.-Mexico trade relations is vital, as Mexico has become an essential part of the American supply chain, especially amid the ongoing US-China trade war, which has spurred a nearshoring boom in Mexico. In 2023, Mexico overtook China as the U.S.'s top trading partner, with trade reaching $799 billion. This shift highlights changing supply chains, trade policies, and geopolitical dynamics in U.S.-Mexico relations.\n\nThe rise of maquiladoras in the 1960s marked the beginning, allowing Mexico to import raw materials duty-free for assembly and export finished products to the U.S., boosting border employment and reducing costs for U.S. manufacturers. NAFTA, enacted in 1994, further integrated North American supply chains by eliminating most tariffs, leading to U.S.-Mexico trade jumping from $81 billion in 1993 to over $614 billion by 2020. This agreement established a strong supply chain, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors, making the U.S.-Mexico border a vital production hub.\n\nDespite its advantages, NAFTA faced criticism over job losses and trade deficits, leading to its replacement by the USMCA in 2018, which introduced stricter regulations, periodic reviews, and updated labor and digital trade provisions for a more balanced trade relationship. Section 321 allows businesses to import low-value shipments (under $800) duty-free, facilitating cross-border trade and significantly boosting e-commerce along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has become ideal for fulfillment centers. However, this loophole has drawn criticism as many Chinese companies, including fast fashion brands like Shein and Temu, have exploited it, with reports indicating that nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. come from China.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war and COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains, prompting U.S. companies to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Mexico's proximity, trade agreements, and affordable labor have made it a preferred alternative, resulting in a nearshoring trend. Interestingly, some Chinese firms are establishing factories in Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs, labeling goods as \"",

They bypass customs by going directly to the USA and clearing under the $800 de minimus value.\n\n1000s of products are consolidated into 40ft containers and shipped from China to the USA. However, since the products have already been purchased they can clear customs as individual packages (typically under $800) vs cleared as a container with all the products going to 1 buyer ($40k +)\n\nOther than that this is a great post!",

As I neared graduation, I received multiple internship offers from reputable companies in various sectors but chose to pursue a mortgage opportunity due to the appealing salary, despite noticing many warning signs. I now regret that choice, as I was laid off after a year. I used the layoff to fulfill my long-held dream of moving abroad with my family to study Spanish in Latin America. After returning nine months ago, I became disillusioned with job prospects in supply chain management and took a random job with the railroad. I initially thought re-entering the SCM field would be easy given the internships available post-college, but now I'm overlooked for better-paying roles. I'm uncertain about my interest in SCM since I've never worked directly in it, and I feel lost and unhappy about my next steps. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated.",

If that is basically correct, then you need to do three things to get some order into your life so you are not 'aimless'. There answer is in your comment: you need to aim at something so you need a target. And, my friend, you are going to have to work your arse off. \n\nThe problem is, you are not sure if the target you're aiming at is the one you want to hit. Let me tell you, there are lots of targets in life and achieving each one leads to setting the next target so stop thinking you need to nail it right the first time. \n\n1. Family budget: you cannot do anything until you have a transparent family budget. You MUST provide for your family so I suggest you head over to Dave Ramsey and use his plan and get yourself locked in. Also, if you can cut some costs out so you can take a lower paying role then that can help broaden your options\n\n2. If you have truely learned Spanish then use that to your advantage: be a manager that runs people in entry level roles whose mother tongue is probably Spanish e.g., warehouse manager. Alternatively, SALES. Yep, it's cliche but everyone needs a sales person and if you can get into sales in any career you can transition to other companies or into operations.\n\n3. Commit. You've followed your heart, now it's time to follow the path of being a provider, father and husband. Read 12 Rules for Life and Can't Hurt Me. They map it all out for you BUT you need to do the work.\n\nAll the best!",

Alternatively you could get your CPIM in the meantime and build up your resume more. If you can’t find work then grad school might be a good choice but you’ll get more out of grad school with experience, especially if there are projects involved. Also I would say work in supply chain before getting the masters because you might not like it. I have friends who left supply chain, including one who did an MBA with a supply chain specialization and had a bit of a challenge breaking out after being a sourcing manager for several years.",

        "content": "Risk management in supply chain in an emergency environment\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n1.Reseach Background:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMore and more companies are increasingly concerned about the rise of supply chain risks. Hence, understanding global supply chain risk management is vital and a top priority for both practitioners and academics. Many scholars revived interest in risk management, particularly in global supply chains. Hauer (2003) proposed that in today's increasingly complex environment, risk-adjusted supply chain management can translate into improved financial performance and competitive advantage.  A risk or disaster means any situation that occurs suddenly and whose influence may increase in intensity; it stops society from its traditional functioning and causes losses to life, the environment, and economies (Kılcı et al., 2015, Kaur and Singh, 2019). Disaster management involves the fulfilment of some operations before and after the occurrence of a disaster to reduce its detrimental effects (Galindo and Batta, 2013, Oruc and Kara, 2018, Sarma et al., 2019). For example, COVID-19 is a disaster that hit the globe in late 2019 and has involved about 203 countries, affected more than 754,000 people, and taken the lives of about 36,500 individuals up to the end of March 2020. It has to mentioned that these statistics concern to the end of March 2020; significantly, the numbers of infected people and mortality rates change every day (WHO, 2020).\r  \n\r  \nThe global spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia has seriously influenced the main suppliers of intermediate products. With the duration and expansion of the epidemic affected, the production of global products has been affected by restrictions on population movements and transport control. At the beginning of the coronavirus, masks, disinfectant water and other hygiene products were exported in large quantities from China to the United States and Europe in March and April. The impact of the Coronavirus outbreak has been significant for the global transport industry. In the international transport of goods, the outbreak in many nations and the spread of the disease around the world have already had an impact on the global supply chain, with businesses shutting down, demand for shipping transport shrinking, and global shipping experiencing problems such as shrinking operations and backlogs of goods. This has made it difficult for these supplies to reach their destinations in a timely. Hence, it is vitally important to observe the entire supply chain, across all nations when choosing and implementing risk management strategies.\r  \n\r  \nSurprisingly, however, there is a lack of conceptual frameworks and empirical findings to provide clear meaning and standardising guidance on the phenomenon of global supply chain risk management. Many pieces of research ignore high‐impact, low‐likelihood risks. By understanding the variety and interconnectedness of supply chain risks, managers can tailor balanced, effective risk‐reduction strategies for their companies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of risk management and risk management strategies in global supply chains.\r  \n\r  \n2.Research objects:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nGlobal supply chains are riskier than domestic supply chains due to numerous links interconnecting an extensive network of firms. These links tend to disruptions, breakdowns, bankruptcies, macroeconomic and political changes, and disasters leading to higher risks and making risk management difficult (Manuj and Mentzer,2008).\r  \nAlthough very important, risk management in the supply chain has not received lots of attention. Many strategies have been suggested, but there is little research focus on global supply chain especially in coronavirus epidemic. Recently, the world is faced with a contradiction between strong demand and insufficient supply. Besides, the import and export trade of many countries is affected. International logistics are severely affected, resulting in overcapacity for many producers, and agents and distributors are unable to receive goods in time, leading to short financial chains.\r  \nThis research will address this gap and provide some advice to the supply chain future development based on existing literature and qualitative research. This study will address several questions, firstly the types of risks in global chains and secondly how to choose the right strategy to deal with the risks in the chain in particular situations.",

Opt for the solution that grants you more control and saves costs at the same. In proactive VM, continuous contact is essential.  \nIf you want to propel vendors to deliver, make sure internal processes are smooth. With advanced vendor management software, businesses can achieve their goals at a lightning speed. Also, opt for a compliant vendor management solution that allows you to make periodic assessments and ensure there’s no risk attached to the industry standards.  \nIt is also vital to ensure supply chain continuity and resilience when you look for alternative vendor management plans. Risk management is another key consideration to select the best VM solution. Your objective should be to work side-by-side with vendors and mitigate risks. With regular performance evaluation and management of suppliers, you can resolve issues before they spiral out of control.  \nDespite what vendor management solution you choose, innovation should be at the center of it. In order to develop and grow in a competitive market, businesses need to embrace new technologies. Effective vendor management positions your business to leverage the benefits of the newest changes in the products or services.",

This decision is influenced by articles and videos he found online about the field, though he acknowledges he’s still unsure about the specifics of the day-to-day tasks and has come across conflicting information. While he knows it’s a broad area, he’s seeking insights into typical daily responsibilities. Will he primarily work on a computer? His grades in STEM subjects are good, but he dislikes them. He’s okay with using Excel daily, but if logistics and SCM roles require extensive math, programming, or number crunching for eight hours a day, he may reconsider. He would appreciate the opportunity to job shadow someone to gain more confidence in his choice, but we don’t know anyone in supply chain to ask. Any insights would be helpful.",

This is mostly what our projects consisted of. Creating spreadsheets from reports and maintaining some basic KPIs. \n\nOther day to day things are included identifying parts shortages and cutting new POs (which we all had to calculate new usages based on historical data), creating production schedules based on parts on hands and labor allocation. In our situation, we are constantly under pressure to keep the supply chain flowing. \nIt’s definitely not easy. Again, this is a small company with no true MRP system and a very fast paced environment. \n\nI have other friends who have similar roles in much larger companies that have vastly different day to day tasks. \n\nIf he does not like math and science, or would like to be behind the computer screen all day (periodically), I would personally not recommend this field.",

Understanding ERP software (we use SAP) is also big. There are entry level / adjacent positions to planners out there, so I think you can definitely make your background work.",

    "content": "I'm new to Excel and studying core business courses with a focus on SCM. I'm participating in a mobile game mini-event for the next 5 days, and I'm interested in optimizing inputs as a learning exercise. The game simulates a three-stage retail business: a farm producing wheat, a baking station making cakes, and a store selling cakes for coins, which can be used for prizes. The farm generates 16 wheat every 10 seconds, increasing by 1 wheat daily. The baking station has \"employee cards\" that convert a certain amount of wheat into cakes every 10 seconds. Although I didn't input data into Excel from the start, here are the cards with their ratios and percentages, which remain constant while their output increases as they level up. You can draw once daily, and which cards to upgrade is based on luck. Only one character can occupy a slot at a time. \n\n| Left align        | Center align      | Right align      |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Pota lvl.4       | 4 wheat / 8 cakes| 50%              |\n| Bunny Woo lvl.4  | 8 wheat / 12 cakes| 67%              |\n| Dana lvl.5       | 15 wheat / 20 cakes| 75%              |\n| Meles lvl.4      | 20 wheat / 20 cakes| 100%             |\n| Bunny Lan lvl.4  | 28 wheat / 24 cakes| 117%             |\n| Nichol lvl.4     | 40 wheat / 36 cakes| 111%             |\n| Atar lvl.3       | 27 wheat / 24 cakes| 113%             |\n| Balu lvl.5       | 40 wheat / 35 cakes| 114%             |\n\nThe \"retail\" station and \"employee\" cards convert cakes into coins every 10 seconds, with leveling also dictated by luck.

        "content": "Cargo terminal operator here. Avoid wheels under crates. Locally artwork handling is usually done in this way.\nFreight agent arrives and unloads the trucks themselves. This is done with a hydraulic loading platform attached to the truck. The agent moves the cargo manually using a small platform with castor wheels.\nUsually the agent has a load plan I.e how the artwork will be loaded onto an aircraft pallet otherwise our warehouse staff will direct them where to place it. Once the cargo is positioned we will strap and net the cargo securing it for travel.\n\nFreight with wheels is much harder to secure as it is more likely to move in transit. There is normally friction between the cargo and the aircraft pallet/shoring which helps prevent movement. Strapping and nets do the rest. Having cargo on wheels means that friction is gone and extra strapping is required in multiple directions.",

So you scan in the items at the time of receiving, and also can while putting them away in specific locations. This way you have the digital footprint of what was received, and added to inventory. Similarly, on the outbound side, you can scan the items out against the order/pick ticket so you will have a complete digital footprint of the IN & OUT movements.\n\nNow during the stock take, your software ideally should have a mobile app that allows you to create a cycle count plan either instantaneously, or scheduled at pre-defined intervals. The plan should let you do a digital scan of inventory by SKUs and locations or both. The scanned quantities against a plan should then compare the inventory against the previous record of inventory in the system, and show you the discrepancies, along with options to do necessary adjustments. We do this using our software (Hopstack)",

If you're considering using an Excel spreadsheet to log and manage inventory, you'll first need an online QR code generator to create unique QR codes for each type of consumable item. Your spreadsheet should include columns for item names, quantities, order thresholds, and other relevant details. However, setting this up in Excel can be quite time-consuming. You might find that investing in a barcode-based inventory management software could be equally cost-effective, considering the time and effort saved compared to manually setting up and maintaining spreadsheets.",

        "content": "Use an inventory tracking or warehouse management system. A lot of times, when you're starting off or are a small business, the ROI in granularly tracking every single item doesn't really justify the effort and cost involved. But if the cost of theft is significantly higher than what you can potentially save by putting in the effort of tracking every single piece of item through a proper system, that's where I would start.\n\nOne of the things that you can implement is having item-level barcodes, if you don't have it already. Scan the item in and scan it out through a proper inventory management or warehouse management system. Ensure that every movement of that inventory, whether it's moving from one location to another or from the bulk storage area to the fulfillment area, is tracked via scan-in and scan-out.\n\nInstitute a proper cycle count process, which is an audit process. Ensure that the system you choose or are using also has a built-in functionality for cycle counts, where you can go through the counting of inventory on a frequent basis. Since currently, you're facing this theft problem, I would recommend having the cycle count at a slightly higher frequency, perhaps once every month, or even more frequent if needed. Once you start to get a better handle on this inventory discrepancy issue, you can reduce the frequency of your cycle counts to perhaps once a quarter, or something like that. Instituting this process and standard operating procedures will at least send the message within your team that there's now a proper tracking system. This change in itself might deter any internal theft if it's occurring. However, even if you do all of this, there might still be a chance of theft. But unless you start patting employees down like airport security, which I wouldn't recommend as it creates a low-trust environment, it's about finding a balance.\n\nI would start with implementing a proper inventory tracking or warehouse management system, barcoding SKUs and every item if possible, tracking the movement of every location through scan-in and scan-out, and instituting a frequent cycle count or SKU audit process",

Audit the Process: Look at your data entry and inventory processes to see if there is room for manual errors. Sometimes, software misalignment or manual adjustments can also cause issues.\n\n3. Introduce Tracking & Automation: Automated systems like ASRS can help by tracking each item’s movement and reducing the need for manual counting, which often helps prevent both theft and errors.\n\n4. Communicate Carefully: Rather than announcing outright suspicions, you might consider framing it as a routine process improvement. That way, you can gather insights without creating defensiveness.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck sorting it out!",

In my bathroom remodeling company, we need to check in items for each job. Due to the varying sizes of materials, they can't all be stored together, leading to disorganization in the warehouse. I considered printing barcodes for each item upon check-in and scanning them along with their storage locations. Is this feasible? Our warehouse staff is not tech-savvy, and existing solutions seem overly complex. I want to simplify processes without complicating their work. We're currently wasting too much time searching for items or repurchasing lost materials. Please assist!",

My boss creates random \"part numbers\" in QuickBooks, sometimes forgetting how he named them. My question is: Is there a program that allows me to scan the original UPC label on an item and have it display the product name he used in QuickBooks instead of the UPC numbers? For instance, when I scan a UPC for glasses, the computer shows the UPC numbers, but I want it to display \"Polarized Safety Glasses Black Frame.\" I want the scanner to function as a keyboard without interacting with QuickBooks. I know I can create my own barcodes that correspond to custom names, but is there a way to have the original UPC display text instead? My boss likely won't agree to re-label items with new barcodes.

Our current price list is scattered across hundreds of Excel files created by my father, which is inefficient. When a client asks for a price, I have to manually search through these files without a centralized system, making it difficult to keep everything updated and often requiring extra trips to the office for information. Each file contains the item name, photo, description, and price. While we don’t sell online, we do list most items on our website. I'm looking for software to simplify this process. It should: serve as a price list for product info and prices, have a hierarchical menu for categories, support formatted text (especially tables), be mobile-friendly, generate QR codes for easy access to item info, include photos, and allow easy export for website upload. I've tried Sortly, but it lacks formatted text options, and Odoo seems too complex. I need something simple that older staff can use, as I’ll be the one updating it and training them. Has anyone encountered a similar issue? Any suggestions for a simpler solution? Thank you!",

If they are large items (e.g., furniture) the barcode goes on the item.\n\nThen you should now how many of which item you have in stock. \n\nThen organize the warehouse by similarity or usage of the item. Eg all living room items together, all bathroom items together, all kitchen items together. \n\nWhen you scan any item out, it will get deducted from a central data base so everyone has the information. Same thing when it is returned.\n\nTake a look at this video for ideas.\n\n[https://youtu.be/GxO2SvlUHj8?si=y8A4QN4HVwjulXq-](https://youtu.be/GxO2SvlUHj8?si=y8A4QN4HVwjulXq-)\n\nThis might be an interim solution, but more importantly it will force the current inventory to be counted and tagged. Then, you might move to a paid app that does more, but also has a monthly fee.",

Managing large volumes of furniture and décor manually using Excel and paper tags is a challenge—especially as your space grows or becomes more dynamic.\n\n\n\nSince you’re in need of an interim solution before rolling out a full ERP, you might want to consider using a more automated inventory management system that can quickly tag and track furniture pieces. I’ve seen some teams switch to using mobile scanning apps with QR codes or RFID tags to streamline this. This kind of solution can work well to track not just the current location of items but also their status—whether they’re in use, reserved for a model, or ready for reallocation.\n\n\n\nIn terms of organizing your space, setting up aisle and bin labels will definitely help, especially if you pair it with a digital system that visually maps where each item is stored. AI-based tools are now making it easier to organize warehouses by generating efficient storage recommendations based on usage data, size, and frequency of access—this could be helpful when stacking large furniture that’s hard to view at a glance.\n\n\n\nI've come across some solutions that integrate inventory tagging and tracking with order fulfillment, and they’re really effective in eliminating manual errors while boosting efficiency. If you’re interested, I can share more about how AI is being used in inventory management for similar industries and how it could apply to your warehouse.\n\n\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to dive deeper into this—I’m happy to chat and explore options that might work for your specific needs!",

For context, my company uses QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise for bookkeeping and operates a WooCommerce website integrated with QB for invoicing. While this setup works reasonably well, managing inventory is challenging. Currently, inventory is tracked through QB upon invoicing, but receiving and counting are done manually. I believe a barcode system would greatly improve our pick/pack and inventory processes, yet QB Desktop appears limited in inventory functionality. Should we switch to a different software entirely, or is there a lightweight scanning solution that integrates well with QBD? Thank you!",

For the past two years, we've used spreadsheets for inventory, but now that it's low, we want to find a better, simpler option. Ideally, the system should work on computers, iPads, and phones for documenting items on the go. Built-in label printing features would be a bonus, but it's not essential. We sell online and in-house, and some items may be scrapped, kept, or upcycled, so adding notes would be helpful. Since we often receive multiple items of the same type, being able to track different processes for these items would be beneficial. Thank you in advance for your assistance!",

The solution was to create a new database, populate it with sample data, launch and stop the server, and then import the existing database.

You can achieve this by triggering events when the barcode is scanned, ensuring that your barcode system is truly useful.",

        "content": "Are you stuck with Odoo? I would not recommend it for any inventory management or MRP uses. \n\nStory Time: Around 3 years ago, a startup hired me to implement Odoo MRP at their site. Their engineering team chose the software because it hooked up to their PLM. I have implemented other mid-size MRPs, so I know what they are supposed to be able to do. The company had already financially committed to Odoo, so I did my best to make it work.  The tool was completely lacking basic MRP features. I worked on it for 6 weeks before I urged the complany to abandon Odoo and try another tool. Eventually, they had to take legal action for a partial refund.\n\nThe main problem: \n\nWhen running MRP you normally expect to put in a few parameters - time, warehousing locations to include, etc - and get a list of items that will fall short at some point in your time range so you can mitigate the issues. In Odoo (3 years ago), you were required to input an item for Odoo to reply with whether it would be short. The user input was me telling Odoo what items to look at instead of Odoo telling me what items were in trouble.\n\nAdditional complaints:\n\nAt the time there was no way to set Odoo to disallow negative inventory quantities. When I asked about it they said we could download open source add-ons or hire someone to develop that feature for us. Nonnegative inventory is one of the most basic inventory settings I can think of.\n\nI repeatedly asked Odoo for references of ANY other manufacturing customers that were using Odoo so I could discuss how they were solving specific issues (since Odoo was unable to answer my questions). They would say yes and then never deliver. I swear I asked 10 times.\n\nOdoo would not give me a chart of their data tables or a way to export data.\n\nThe reporting options were atrocious. They couldn't even show me how to make a basic phone list from the user table.\n\n  \nTLDR: I looked at Odoo in depth 3 years ago. They sold a half-baked product and evaded any questions that highlighted this fact. Whether or not the MRP module has improved since then, I would not consider Odoo again due to this experience.",

We aim for a seamless transition of our items, managing over 1,000 unique items each month, each requiring a specific code in the barcode. We will manually input these codes. I’d like to know if it's possible to connect a barcode printer to inventory software so that a barcode prints automatically whenever we add an item, allowing us to stick it directly onto the product. We want to avoid generating and printing barcodes separately in different software. Can anyone help or explain this to us? If you know of any inventory software that offers this feature, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions.",

    "content": "Hello. I'm seeking tips on inventory control as I'm relatively new to it. I've been tasked with managing inventory across various stores in our retail chain after starting in a management role. Despite conducting multiple inventories over the past six months, we haven't achieved accurate ERP inventory levels. The main challenge is that we conduct inventories while stores are open, section by section, which can't be changed. My boss expects accurate stock, but I’m struggling to achieve this quickly. My current strategy includes: - Recently completing an inventory in our stores. - Assigning each store manager to perform daily inventory checks at two locations, ensuring rotation and identifying discrepancies. I hope this leads to improved accuracy in future counts, with discrepancies then linked to product loss or unlogged operations in the ERP. What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you think it will enhance stock accuracy, or can you suggest a better method based on your experience?",

For instance, within 6-12 months you need to get around to and cycle count all the items in the store. Not just the same ones.\n\nWhat I would do in that instance, is pull a 12 month sales report by item and classify the fastest movers with the most volume to be counted the most frequenty. Maybe daily or weekly. Then on down from there. The slowest moving item may get counted once or twice a year.\n\n100% accuracy is just not realistic in ANY inventory I've been around. One of the issues is, I've never seen 100% anywhere. And if you put it on a chart, the cost starts going up dramatically the closer you want to be near 100%. If you're storing gold bars, fine, but on socks with shrinkage maybe not so much? See?",

Because they're so specific to the client's unique requirements, it wouldn't be possible to sell them to anyone else without major modifications either.\n\nAnother reason clients come to me is because of gaps that exist in the ERP/MRP they might be using. I plug those gaps by automating manual processes that must be carried out in individual situations that those larger systems simply do not cover.\n\nAnother reason a custom solution might make sense is if you're not terribly keen on spending bucket loads of money for features you will never need, and instead would like something that simply does what you want for much less than a larger and more complicated system will cost you.",

We currently estimate production time by comparing when workers clock in at a station to the number of parts processed during a shift, but this method lacks accuracy for specific parts. I want to implement a system that tags each part with a barcode, allowing it to be scanned in and out at each station during processing.

Do you need just in/out scans, or are you looking to have recurring whole-site scans (either mounted or from a hand-held sled) to show your on hand inventory? Hardware is a big piece of it, but just as important is how you integrate the data flows and reporting.",

We have about 15 employees, with only 1 or 2 managing inventory. We purchase from vendors weekly but don’t need to track spending. Our focus is on tools, consumables, safety supplies, and fleet management. We want to track and attach documents to our fleet (trucks) and tools. We don’t sell products or engage in eCommerce, and most software I’ve reviewed emphasizes selling, which doesn't suit our needs. We have a main warehouse and potentially another for job sites, and we need to track stock transfers and item adjustments when sending out tools and consumables. I've looked into Zoho, Sortly, and Unleashed, but they all focus on selling. Any recommendations would be appreciated, and I’m happy to provide more details if needed. Thanks!",

You can also use dedicated barcodes that include quality assurance processes or referencing a manufacturing process. \n\nRegistered barcodes - common barcodes you register in places for things like Amazon (global standard barcodes) and for sharing with retailers who resell your products.

My question is how many weeks' worth of parts we should keep in inventory. If we sell X units per week, I assume we need to maintain X/W, where W is the weeks of inventory needed. While we can forecast X, I'm struggling to find resources to determine W. We aim to operate under a Kanban system and need guidance on the appropriate size for these kanbans. Thank you!",

        "content": "Not sure I understand correctly but will try to help. \n\nSounds like you are trying to calculate safety stock. \n\nIf you have a part with 12 week lead time and you consume 3 parts per week on average. You should have 3 parts available per week for 12 weeks. So the safety stock level should be 36 units in inventory. \n\nIt means you should keep your minimum inventory level for this item at 36 units and order it again when it hits that balance or before hitting that balance. \n\nSo the most important thing is to understand consumption rates per week and multiply it by lead times to determine how much inventory you need to keep in order to satisfy demand and reduce lead time to end customers",

        "content": "For determining the optimal number of weeks worth of parts to keep on hand (W), here are some considerations to help you decide:\n\n\t1.\tLead Time Variability: Given your suppliers’ lead times range from 1 to 12 weeks, you’ll want to base W on the longest lead time to avoid stockouts. So, a safe starting point could be 12 weeks of inventory.\n\n\t2.\tSafety Stock calculated based on the standard deviation of your lead times and demand.\n\n\t3.\tDemand Forecasting using historical sales data, seasonal trends, and any other relevant factors will help you maintain appropriate inventory levels.\n\n\t4.\tKanban Sizing: The size of your Kanban should be based on the consumption rate and the lead time. A simple formula for Kanban size is:\n\nKanban Size = Daily Usage × (Lead Time + Safety Factor)\n\nThis ensures you have enough parts to cover consumption during the replenishment cycle.\n\nDid you try to implement something like this?",

Which is tough to forecast.\n\nIf you're talking parts as in materials for manufacturing, then I would say there is never a clear cut answer without actually seeing and analyzing what you're doing. For example if you make shit out of raw steel all day every day, you might get sheets and coils of steel daily or several times a day. But an ABC analysis might have you turning A items twice a month, C items 4 or 5 times a year. Whereas a lean zealot might try to make you run as close to \"zero\" inventory as possible.\n\nHope that makes some sense.",

We order products from two overseas countries and have domestic suppliers, with around 500 SKUs (none assigned yet). We manufacture in-house, bagging products in various sizes, creating blends, and other composite items. We're struggling with ordering due to varying lead times from suppliers, making it hard to maintain stock levels. We sell online via a WooCommerce storefront and currently operate one warehouse, with plans for another overseas. We make about 2,000-2,500 sales monthly, generating roughly $1 million in annual revenue. I'm looking for ERP software but there are many options, and it's tough to determine what suits us best. I spoke with Inflow, but they said we weren't a fit, and I've heard mixed reviews about Fishbowl. I'm also considering Katana. I'd appreciate any recommendations or experiences you can share.",

CIN7 and Katana are the best fits for BOM, Production scheduling and supporting manufacturing use cases. And with Katanas dynamic planner which books materials to manufacturing based on priority, I think this will be a real winner for tracking when things can be made and what can be made. Will help a lot with your workflow and estimated lead times. Cin7 is best suited for 15+ million USD type businesses in my opinion, so it’s probably overkill. \n\nFishbowl also does support this, but the reviews are still a mixed bag.",

    "content": "Last week, DAT informed my boss about transferring our company on November 17. They executed it an hour ago; I was first, followed by my boss 15 minutes later. I had seen this coming and logged out immediately each time. I convinced myself it wasn’t real and held onto hope until the end. I only had one truck left for Sunday and was casually looking at loads for Monday, booking a few. But then I encountered the awful web design—a frustrating, unintuitive interface that required extra clicks, displayed only five searches at once, and blocked other posts with blank space when viewing comments. The \"book now\" button took up twice the space of the email area, making it hard to see the email without right-clicking. I couldn’t block Canadian loads by default and had to do it for each shipment, and duplicating searches was impossible. The alert sound was dreadful. After accessing my Truckstop account with another company, I was shocked by how much better it was. Sorry, Truckstop, for not realizing how user-friendly you were. The lag was unbearable, freezing ten times in 30 minutes as I struggled to comprehend the logic behind this abomination. I booked a random load, told my boss I couldn’t handle this nightmare any longer, and went to the bar. I’ll probably call my boss tomorrow to show him Truckstop. I know it has fewer loads for dry vans, but that might not last. I’m still having flashbacks and trying to accept this new tool; only swearing comes to mind as I grapple with my new reality. Happy Friday, everyone, and have a good weekend. I've attached a picture of my first drink tonight; I don’t understand why they served Metaxa in two glasses when I’m alone—maybe they thought someone had passed away.",

        "content": "So make sure we’re on the same page, you sell and manage accounts for a motor carrier who just got dual authority. Your new role would be to keep bringing in freight for the assets and start pulling in freight to broker. You’re the sole account manager for any account you land, and for brokered freight, you’re the customer- and carrier-side load manager. No billing, compliance, or management duties. \n\nForget percentages. Don’t let them trick you into selling, managing accounts, AND operating brokered loads. As you land more accounts, you spend more time managing the accounts and operating loads, so you sell less and less, until you have no time to sell. You can barely quote and cover all the loads and still keep your customers happy, so landing another account is a nightmare. Your income stagnates. \n\nI wrote that like a horror story but if you can sell, it’ll happen. So keep the base and percentage, maybe try bumping up to 3% or 4% but more importantly make them agree to hire an operator once you hit a certain (LOW) monthly load count.\n\nPitch it like an investment, they’re agreeing to buy back your time at a certain point so you can keep growing their revenue. Not even a big investment, broker ops you basically need a high school diploma and know how to email.",

After confirming with the original broker that it was their load, they referred to it as \"co-brokering\" and requested to be removed. Later, I received an email from the \"owner\" of the company expressing frustration about my guy. When my guy called him, he was very upset and insisted we run the load, even threatening to file a report in a strong Eastern European accent, despite claiming to be French and named James Parker. Honestly, I don't understand why he was so upset over a $450 load. We don't mind if others profit from brokers' freight, but we won't carry it due to our principles.",

Despite including details in the rate confirmation, discussing them over the phone, and sending follow-up emails, I still have to fine about one in every 15 loads. Why is it so difficult to call and report a problem? Just communicate, and there won't be an issue. Instead, I learn about delays or no-shows from my client. I only discover issues like missing scale tickets or incorrect blind deliveries when I receive the invoice. These are all solvable with effective communication. I'm also interested in what fines other brokers impose for late deliveries or poor communication, as well as for late or missing paperwork.",

Because I want carriers available to do my loads, and I don't want them clucking at the truck stop about how I rip them off and not to work with me. Also, if I clip the wrong one they'll file on my bond, and then a bunch of people in the company have to do work to prevent paying out, which costs way more than I made off the fine.\n\nConversely, the best punishment is to put the carrier on the do not use list and tell them politely or otherwise to fuck off when they call. If I really want to be shitty I'll FreightWatch them and they can explain to the world why they don't suck.\n\nBut really? Shit happens, stuff goes wrong, windshield jockeys do windshield jockey shit and it's not worth the static or the bad reputation to hit their pockets constantly.\n\nNow if they cost me money with their craziness? I definitely hit them for every penny it cost me plus an asshole tax, and that's why that stuff is really in the rc, so I have that option.\n\nOther than that?

For example, if we project 50 loads over six months, the rebate levels would be: 3% for 38 loads, 2% for 25 loads, and 1% for 15 loads. At the end of the six-month RFQ period, you would pay the rebate based on the actual loads tendered. Would this interest you in securing my business? We apply this approach in purchasing and sales, but I haven't used it in transportation before.",

This isn't common in transportation though as margins are pretty tight and trust is in very short supply.\n\nWhether this rebate will be tolerable to a vendor is going to be based on whether or not the rate they offered you makes sense after paying the rebate.\n\nIf I saw this rebate program on something I was bidding I would just add 4% to every single lane immediately. You can do anything you want, but the way people react to it (especially something that isn't standard to transportation like this) is going to be to raise your prices by more than it could possibly cost them.\n\nHonestly in trucking it usually works the other way. Someone moves more volume for you they get more money per move not less (you're paying them for the convenience of not having to find one new vendor per load which is the \\*default\\* in trucking, which is why freight brokerages exist int he first place). Right now the gap between contract rates and spot rates is in the 15-20% range on a lot of lanes lol.",

    "content": "I'm unsure how to approach this, but I thought I'd ask here. I transported an oversized load from corner to corner to Stuart, FL. I had another load from Ft. Lauderdale to Maine that wouldn't be ready for a few days, also oversized. The broker who sent me to Stuart asked if I could drop that load and take one back to Oregon in 5 days. I agreed and checked with the customer, who wasn't happy but understood. I found a suitable carrier at my quoted price, and everything seemed fine. However, on day 5, as I drove toward the shipper, the broker called to say the load wouldn’t be ready for another 3 days and offered a rate increase. I had to stay in a hotel since I was in a triple axle day cab. After 8 idle days, the shipper informed me the load wouldn't be ready for weeks. I had to rush back west for another load from Washington on a Friday, missing out on other opportunities. I lost a $28,000 rate confirmation and had to drop a $16,000 load while waiting. Filing on bonds typically leads to the same response: “take it to court, and if you win, we’ll pay,” but nothing was hauled, just lost chances and extra costs. When this happens with a broker, do you usually block their number and send a middle finger emoji? Lawsuits are difficult, but it's hard to stay in business with brokers like this. I'm curious how others have dealt with similar situations. Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "The waiting is on you so forget that first load. You also made a choice to wait 5 days for a better load while dropping what you had booked. I get it, better money is always better money, but not at the expense of pissing off a customer. Had the first load been crap or a nightmare shipper then you have a point on why you dropped it. Doesn't really matter, but people who give out cheap freight expect things like that sometimes. Anyway, you can't do anything about waiting for 5 days, the extra 3 days is also on you because again, you waited. You could ask for a TONU but thats peanuts compared to the rate con. IMO, this is all on you. Choose better brokers and for sure stick with a good paying load. Had you of went with what you booked you wouldn't have sat idle for 8 days then deadhead to Washington.........",

        "content": "Vlad here, carrier. It's pointless, because saying we had a breakdown is the \"safest\" option we have. We lie to you all the time. I've worked in 9 or 10 different carriers as a dispatcher before I opened my own company  and the real breakdown rate varies. It's as high as 33% in some shittier carriers with older equipment and the cheapest drivers they  could find to as low as 10% with brand new Ryder / Penske leases that you get a \"sub-unit\" if you break down and keep driving. Also special note for reefers - Carrier units are completely disgusting and MAGNITUDES worse than Thermo King. Unfortunately they are prevalent since they are cheaper. \n\nSo why do we lie? Sometimes the driver fell asleep. The worst thing you can do is wake him up and push him to drive . That's how accidents happen. Dumb dispatchers and greedy company owners will do that, but I'm not that piece of shit and I don't want my drivers to plow through 7 cars full of people. And none of the drivers under my dispatch ever had for 13 years. But I've seen some of the drivers of my former coworkers do that and I don't want to have that on my conscious. \n\nOther times we the driver has irregular bowel movements. Another time we use breakdown as an excuse to cancel a load. Or the driver has an actual emergency. Or his medical expired and we can't put him on a load. Or his CDL got suspended. It's just better to tell you we had a breakdown than to explain the BS we deal with. Just like you tell us \"the customer covered it\" while in reality you never had the load to begin with, moved it cheaper or it got rescheduled - it's not worth the hassle to explain yourself.",

This cycle has certainly been challenging. I was just reminiscing with someone about 3-4 years ago when it was typical to gain 3-5 customers monthly, sometimes even up to 10 with enough effort. This year, I've been averaging two clients per month, despite cold calling extensively without the desired success. We’ve managed to grow about 5% this year, so I can't complain too much. I'm hopeful that next year will make client acquisition easier, but we’ll see. I believe there’s always new business to be found, regardless of the economy. How has your experience been with acquiring new clients?",

The supply chain crisis caused by COVID meant that there was a ton of urgency to get things moving as companies returned to full production. But it was never going to last after things stabilized. Brokers and carriers that made it through COVID benefited because so many others shut down. But customers wised up after the initial surge of giving out freight to pretty much anyone at any cost. And I think that even if the market is truly rebounding, it'll be a long time before we see margins like we did in 2021-2022.",

Check every single fee they will charge you. Check if it's recourse or non-recourse funding. Check if you have to have your entire portfolio factored or if you can pick and choose customers. What are the terms of your contract? How do you get out of it when that time comes and you can afford your own payables?\n\nI own a transportation factoring company so shoot me any questions you might have.",

When I left and switched to a new brokerage I was looking for a few things. I wanted to see my weekly, monthly, yearly commission statements in a timely manner. I didn’t want to worry getting nickeled and dimed to death about this customer gets this % this customer gets this %. I wanted a flat % on every load I moved. I didn’t want to worry about people stealing my customers. I wanted the control to pick and choose my carriers and not worry about them getting black balled by another broker. The brokerage in Cincinnati let’s people go every single day. If your not afraid of their non compete just watch the linkendin posts of people recently getting laid off. They might not have a big book of business but they are at least trained. You can also offer a % 1099 agent split but most agent programs are 50-70%. Can you also offer the back end supports established agents would be looking for? Just food for thought. Also could look up guys that there companies have closed down and are looking for a new home. Other way to recruit is recruit a brand new kid just graduated, train them the way you want them to handle your current business, and then grow your business by you your self spending more time selling. Just food for thought",

FedEx hasn't let me down before, but I recently faced a simple shipment from Washington State to Colorado that cost $933 in freight but had an additional $820 in charges. This included a $327 reweigh fee, even though the origin isn't the shipper and they have a signed scale ticket. They benefit from accurate weights, and I confirmed they have loading docks after calling. Yet, I was hit with a $195 origin limited access charge and a $265 destination limited access fee, despite there being ample room for larger trailers. I've never encountered such charges before; I've only faced overlength fees previously. Watch out for FedEx's pricing practices, as UPS/T-Force hasn't charged me this way.",

Only other carrier to do that unexpectedly was Estes and it was a literal bee hive farm on a dirt road so it felt fair. Tforce is definitely the worst and pickiest about it in my (limited) LTL experience, but always the cheapest. As RR and Estes lately get more competitive though FedEx makes less and less sense.\n\nThey should provide you with their own certified scale weight and signed internal measurements they took if you ask. If the variance is somewhat small, a certain level of rep can reduce or waive it. I never book direct with them, always through an volume-discount agent that can fight these wars for me.",

However, the company won't hire help for tasks like load coverage and check calls. As a result, I'm leaving an additional $40,000 in gross profit on the table each month due to time constraints. I've requested assistance for my accounts multiple times, but instead, they hired eight sales reps who were all let go for failing to acquire customers. I've highlighted that my clients are major industry players willing to connect me with more freight, but I need time to prospect. They have denied my requests for equity, assistance, or a raise, even though my accounts represent 80% of the company's total gross profit. When should I consider taking my accounts and leaving?",

    "content": "We onboarded a new customer selling saunas directly to consumers. Their crates measure 40 inches long, 80 inches wide, 90 inches tall, and weigh 1,500 lbs. Since the company is small, they requested the most affordable delivery option. I suggested using box trucks with liftgates, allowing the driver to use a pallet jack to deliver to customers' homes. Today, our first truck was dispatched, but the driver reported insufficient clearance to access the liftgate for delivery (residential area, no forklift available), so we canceled the truck. The yellow circled areas made it impossible for the driver to reach the liftgate. I realize I made a mistake, and now my customer is seeking another delivery solution for these crates. What would be a suitable alternative? Thank you, and please keep feedback constructive.",

Most brokers rely on Authority age, making my situation worse. I have excellent insurance and a good track record with brokers, but even my regular ones say they can’t assist due to company policy. Is there anything I can do to get back on track, or will I have to start over and struggle for another 3-6 months? Any advice would be appreciated. P.S.

And we are all funds on hand, no credit debt payors with the top scores amongst the carriers factoring companies because we pay out on time, every time. There is no waiting for our clients to pay their invoices. We pay you first and recoup it from our clients.\nI worked elsewhere before (terrible place) where they had almost no carrier compliance rules - if one certain person said that MC is fine, we were to use them, but if something went wrong, we had to pay out of pocket ourselves for doing what we were told to do. \nRide it out, man. Try direct contract freight or direct shippers who may utilize brokers and carriers via load lists. Yes, it'll suck, but it's only 3 months. Then you can get in with the better shippers and real brokers.",

The reefer was set to 34 degrees, with return control between 32 and 37 and discharge control between 24 and 34. Additionally, the BOL clearly states the product was rejected due to “insect damage,” not frost. Two pallets were rejected, and the warehouse retained the rest. It has been two weeks, and they have not provided evidence of frosting. The delivery was made to Kroger, which states the BOL's reason for rejection is the only one that matters. The broker insists the issue is frost and a carrier claim. We believe we are not at fault, yet the broker seems intent on blaming us to withhold our payment.

Trust me Insurance will find every reason to deny coverage and they will have to make up the case with insurance and all have to prove it is a frost issue and if not the insurance will shut them down. As soon as they do that, file on their bond for the load amount and tell them to go F themselves and that you will settle this for court as BOL shows it is insects not frost. They don’t have a leg to stand on at Court, show the  temp recorder and BOL and trailer last inspection that is free of holes\n\nIf they threaten you with a Freight Guard, make sure to record all call conversations and emails and sue them for defamation and remind them that freight guards now aren’t removable and that you will sue for every penny in lost revenue for unlimited time as a result of their fraudulent report and enjoy sleeping and banking on their idiocy. \n\nScumbags brokers like that want to blame it at you because they don’t have a backup insurance so they basically are screwed. They need to understand that in trucking it is all about risk, if you aren’t taking risk, why are you getting a cut of the freight bill when you have no skin.\n\nIf it was one of the good brokers, there are in tough sport and they will most likely be fired by the customer as they won’t be able to pay them back the lost damage that god knows how it was infested at the shipper or even at manufacturer but hey it is trucking every day super risky business in an unsustainable model.",

I've tried various strategies like modifying email templates, personalizing messages, researching clients, and changing call times, but I'm still not getting consistent responses or meaningful connections. For those successful in cold outreach in logistics or similar fields, what strategies worked best for you?

In the scenario where a broker gives a load to a fraudulent carrier, who then hands it off to a legitimate one, the fraudulent carrier can collect payment and vanish without compensating the actual carrier. However, could this be easily prevented by double-checking? For instance: 1. The shipper verifies the expected carrier against the one that arrives; if they don't match, the shipper withholds the load. 2. Alternatively, the driver could confirm with the shipper about the expected carrier to ensure they are authorized. Problem resolved?",

He is seeing things like freight diverted, transloaded, & exported in a matter of days after a theft. The FMCSA is working to add multi-factor authentication. Loadboards are investing a ton on this too. Ultimately, it means more intrusive technologies & more expensive stuff. \n\nNo one really knows how big the issue really is either.

The other is your fucking, anything else and you no longer have a job.'  Ironically enough that's exactly why I was late... my gf (now wife) had jumped me as I was getting ready to head out for work.

My background is in truckload/expedited freight due to better margins. Drayage has always seemed to offer $50-100 margins per load, based on customer requirements, so I've typically passed on those opportunities. I'm considering participating in this significant RFP, which involves tens of thousands of moves annually on certain routes and thousands on others. I'm also wondering if the margins make it worthwhile. I'd work with dedicated drayage carriers, but I'm looking for real-world examples or insights.

My brokers who I work with generally still make $100-$250 a container and I still make out ahead too. \n\n \nI still include assessorials for out of pocket things (storage, weekend deliveries, prepulls more than a day before delivery, reefer/genset, hazmat, overweight etc) but the biggest thing with any Drayage work is making sure the carrier you’re working with can stick to deadlines.  \n\nI probably don’t need to mention this but 9/10 the shipper/receiver needs that container off the ship and into their warehouse ASAP and is likely the bottle neck for a lot more downward operations. At my own cost I staff an extra truck fueled and insured and a part time driver as well for emergencies/breakdowns but my clients love that shit because of how quickly a late container can affect operations. \n\nShameless Plug, hit me up if you’re trying to move stuff out of NJ/NY",

Our bond company unexpectedly dropped us after we renewed in July, citing two claims from carriers who alleged non-payment. We proved we paid, and the claims were closed, but that seems irrelevant. Many companies are unwilling to take us on due to this situation, which is frustrating since anyone can file a claim. Even with our strong financials (on track for over $7 million with a solid P&L), it hasn't helped. We're waiting on two more companies but may need to switch to a BMC-85, which we can do. This situation feels absurd, and while I recognize there's a lot of fraud, I suspect many bond companies will soon be dropping numerous clients.",

It just sits in storage the majority of the time because it's not convenient to use for regular open deck loads. When our customers do need it, we charge \\~50% over our normal rate for it. \n\nSo once you have a customer base, then look into buying specialty trailers to fill the niche needs as needed.",

You could get pretty badly fucked up on something like this. Seriously. Not just lose the customer bad, brokerage gets sued bad. They're asking you to arrange something they should be arranging for a reason and that reason is they want to stick you with the risk. Adverse selection loads in my experience are only ever a good idea when you're great at whatever the thing you're doing is.

Today, I faced rejection from over a dozen brokers due to a \"lack of inspections.\" A few months back, the DOT directed weigh stations to stop allowing voluntary inspections, which was the only way for reputable carriers to receive them. The only other way to get inspected is by behaving unsafely in front of an officer. Random inspections at stations are based on observing issues on camera to flag trucks entering the scale. Compliance teams should rethink the need for inspections; soon, only unsafe carriers will meet this requirement, and is that who you want handling your freight? Safe carriers won't have inspections, causing your brokerage to miss out on partnering with reliable ones.",

I need a system that supports 2-3 drivers, allows route dispatching with check-ins at the start and each stop, and enables photo uploads for pickup and delivery verification—especially important for fine art and fragile items. It would be ideal if shippers could sign a digital BOL within the system and if it included integrated GPS for route triangulation. Currently, I manage everything manually—creating itineraries, triangulating routes, printing BOLs, saving POD photos from emails, and invoicing—which is cumbersome for my drivers. I’m looking to streamline this but can't afford expensive solutions given our size. Does anyone know of a suitable program? What are you using, how many drivers do you have, and what are your costs per month or user?",

They seem unaware of the Safer system or FMCSA and aren't following updates in Safer. Another carrier is going through a divorce, and the co-owner refuses to share logins or handle paperwork, keeping both phones and emails and wanting to disengage completely. I’m feeling very stressed and need suggestions on what to do. I'm concerned that this highway company, which lacks understanding of our industry, might misuse or sell our sensitive information.

This is nothing but paranoid rage bait from people who don't understand the product, what it can and can't access, and what control the carrier has over what information is shared. Highway only pulls information from the FMCSA, what a carrier chooses to provide them, and what they get from a carrier's ins agent. Even the ELD integration is 100% optional for the carrier. Now, a broker may require those things, but that's not Highways choice. \n\nHighway has 0 control over what qualifies a carrier to be used by a particular broker. Those requirements are defined by the broker. If a broker is asking for invasive information, that's on the broker. If you choose to provide that information, that's on you. You want shit like this to stop? Take fraud as seriously as the rest of industry and stop getting your MCs stolen or hijacked, and stop selling them to thieves. Pay attention to your own security practices, and encourage others in the field to take it seriously as well. \n\nAlso OP, if you are having issues it's 90% likely because you are a 3rd party dispatcher working loads for 4 different MCs. Being listed as a contact for the carrier in any other way than as a verified 3rd party dispatcher will get your ass flagged. Figure out what you need to do individually to get verified with Highway and have your carriers list you as a 3rd party dispatcher. It's still up to the broker if you get used at the end of the day, but taking the steps to register legitimately at least tells me you're less likely to be a crook. Contact changes and an unverified 3rd party dispatcher would be an immediate no go for me as well.",

    "content": "I want to share a recent experience and a lesson for carriers. I booked a load for exclusive use with a reliable driver who was on tracking. He informed me he loaded around 2 PM, and tracking showed him leaving the shipper, so I updated my customer. The next day, however, I noticed he was still at the shipper, which was unusual. When I called, he revealed he had been rejected the night before due to having other freight on his truck. He had a friend remove that freight so he could return this morning, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Please, carriers, improve your honesty. Don’t lie in ways that are easily discoverable or that mislead me with my customer. Just say your truck broke down or you had an issue, but don’t claim you’ve been loaded when you haven't. That poor excuse turned a missed pickup into a situation where I misrepresented facts to my customer, making everyone look incompetent.",

    "content": "Using return management software offers several benefits. It’s a one-time investment that effectively supports business growth while decreasing manual tasks, enhancing daily productivity. Here are five key reasons to implement return management software:\n\n**Reason 1: Speed**  \nThis software automates workflows, generates documents, labels, and invoices, and maintains user profiles for quick data allocation on repeated returns. These features significantly accelerate return management and lower the time spent on individual return orders.\n\n**Reason 2: Visibility**  \nReturn management software enhances business visibility and integrity through web-based portals, carrier integration, and bar-coded identifiers. This increased visibility allows for more accurate and efficient shipment handling, reducing costs and improving product recovery.\n\n**Reason 3: Control**  \nIt provides greater control over regulatory compliance, reconciliation, final disposition, and quality assurance. This control bolsters business integrity and enhances customer experience.\n\n**Reason 4: Cost Reduction**  \nThe software helps manage and significantly reduce costs associated with return orders via scheduled pickups, savings on multiple pickups, and improved product recovery. It also minimizes unreasonable returns through effective checks.\n\n**Reason 5: Accuracy**  \nReturn management software ensures accurate returns management with real-time shipment tracking, precise stock management, and better handling of returned and canceled products. This accuracy enhances customer experience by allowing precise responses to availability inquiries.\n\nUnicommerce Return Management software is a leading cloud-based solution that offers comprehensive control over return and cancellation orders. With advanced features and technology, it enables seamless processing and management. Having collaborated with major eCommerce platforms like Jabong, Myntra, and Snapdeal, Unicommerce continuously upgrades its software and has established itself as a formidable market competitor.",

Someone mentioned that experience matters more than a degree, so I'm seeking advice on roles in this field that are less physically demanding and suitable for a newcomer. I'm not strong in math but am willing to learn or take a course if necessary. Additionally, I will have a certified intermediate proficiency in Japanese by graduation. I posted this to avoid feeling lost after graduation and to focus on a goal that will lead me to a position in this field. Thank you for your insights!",

However, I haven't heard back from the recruiter. How long does it typically take to receive an official offer after reference checks? This role is a 2-year term, and as an international student graduating this December, I need a full-time permanent job to qualify for Canadian PR. This position fits well with my 5 years of procurement experience from India, making it a great career move, but I'm worried about the term nature. Does anyone have tips on leveraging such a role for PR and career advancement in Canada? Are there usually internal opportunities within government jobs for transitioning to permanent positions?",

    "content": "# Planning an international move can be thrilling, but it's easy to overlook the hidden costs that can significantly increase the total expenses. This article examines these unexpected expenses, explains their causes, and offers budgeting tips to help you avoid financial surprises and make your move more affordable.\n\n## 1. Customs and Import Duties: Beyond Paperwork\nWhen moving internationally, you must navigate customs regulations, including potential duties and taxes on your belongings. Each country has different laws, and the value of your items may incur additional fees. \n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Research the specific import duties for your destination.  \n- Consult experienced international movers for estimates based on your items.  \n- Prepare for potential delays during customs clearance.\n\n## 2. Packing and Crating: More Than Just Boxes\nPacking is often a hidden cost that requires specialized materials for fragile or high-value items, contrary to the assumption that standard boxes will suffice. \n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Obtain a detailed packing estimate from your mover.  \n- Consider packing some items yourself to save costs, but recognize that fragile items may still need professional handling.  \n- Reuse packing materials from previous moves if possible.\n\n## 3. Shipping Delays: The Cost of Waiting\nShipping delays can significantly impact your moving budget and timeline, with common delays occurring at ports and customs.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Budget for a longer timeline to accommodate potential delays.  \n- Inquire about storage costs if your items need to be held temporarily.\n\n## 4.

Currency Fluctuations: The Impact on Costs\nCurrency fluctuations can affect moving costs, particularly if your move involves multiple currencies. A drop in your home currency can lead to higher expenses.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Lock in currency exchange rates when possible.  \n- Monitor rates leading up to your",

    "content": "The current model for chartering ships to transport goods by sea has developed over several centuries and involves a broker as an intermediary between the shipowner and charterer. This broker negotiates freight contract terms, addressing various transportation details such as loading norms, berth time for cargo operations, cargo release, port services, and transportation costs. Their expertise enables effective communication with both parties, typically charging a 2% commission from each, which increases the contract value by 4-5% and negatively impacts overall transportation economics. Frank Freight offers a solution that allows stakeholders to operate independently, make quicker decisions, and select available vessels or cargo. We believe that removing brokers from this open platform will reduce negotiation time, lower transportation costs, and enhance profitability for both charterers and shipowners.",

    "content": "Chaos in Chittagong 🚢 Bangladesh, a major player in global apparel exports, faced unprecedented turmoil due to political unrest and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, leading to historic congestion at Chittagong Port, crucial for trade. Delays and rising costs prompted international brands like H&M and Zara to reconsider their sourcing strategies. Bangladesh's status as a leading garment exporter was at risk. Can it navigate this crisis and maintain its role in the global supply chain? Discover how the unrest is influencing the global apparel market and Bangladesh’s prospects. Clash of the Titans 📦 Business rivalries often resemble epic dramas filled with ambition and high-stakes conflicts. Think of the iconic competition between Apple and Microsoft that shaped the digital age, or the legendary showdown between Ferrari and Ford in automotive history. Now, in e-commerce, Amazon and Walmart are fiercely competing for supremacy. Who will emerge victorious in this online battle? Here’s our analysis of Amazon vs. Walmart. Homemade Chips 📱 The smallest elements can have the greatest impact, and semiconductor chips are prime examples. These tiny components drive technological advancements and economic growth. However, with production dominated by Taiwan, South Korea, and China, the U.S. faces vulnerabilities. The CHIPs Act represents America’s effort to regain its position and diversify the global semiconductor supply chain. We’ll examine the CHIPs Act’s journey, its effects over the past two years, and its implications for the U.S. and global semiconductor sectors. Find the complete story here. Mississippi Burning 🔥 Climate change is disrupting global supply chains, with severe droughts and extreme weather causing major issues. In the U.S., the Mississippi River, a critical trade route, has experienced significant drought, resulting in shipping delays and increased costs. The Panama Canal has also been affected by low water levels, leading to congestion and impacting global trade. These events highlight the vulnerability of supply chains. We investigate the causes, impacts, and implications of these disruptions, as well as the economic effects of climate-related events and how industries are adapting.

I understand I'd need to return to school, but I'm willing to do so. My goal is to monopolize the PMC market without owning the companies, akin to how Amazon operates with various sellers on its platform. I recognize the risk of attacks on such a ship, so I plan to establish a private navy, ideally offering \"naval security\" to combat piracy and patrol key maritime routes like the Panama Canal and Suez Canal.

The benefits of online shopping, like price differences, product variety, promotions, multiple payment and delivery options, and easy returns, make it a preferred choice for many. However, this surge in demand poses challenges for warehouse owners and managers. To address these issues, many warehouses are adopting advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and productivity. Here are the Top 5 smart technologies currently used in warehouses: \n1. Automated Picking and Sorting tools for efficient storage and increased productivity. \n2. Automated Guided vehicles and conveyor belts for moving stock within the warehouse. \n3. IoT implementation with sensors and data integration to improve accuracy and minimize manual intervention in stock maintenance. \n4. Automated drones with scanners for tracking and counting products, simplifying annual inventory counts.",

    "content": "Understanding the distinction between cost to supply and cost to serve is essential for enhancing profitability in logistics and supply chain management. Both terms relate to the expenses of delivering products to customers, yet they offer different insights. \n\nCost to supply refers to the production and distribution expenses involved in moving a product from the manufacturer to a warehouse or store, including raw materials, manufacturing, and logistics like transportation and warehousing. In contrast, cost to serve (CTS) provides a customer-focused perspective on costs, encompassing supply chain costs plus additional expenses such as customized packaging, promotional costs, returns processing, and specific service level agreements (SLAs). Essentially, it represents the total cost of meeting customer needs.\n\nUnderstanding cost to serve can reveal that certain customers or products may be less profitable than they seem when only considering cost to supply. This is due to cost to serve factoring in specific customer demands that can raise costs, such as last-mile delivery to remote areas or 24/7 customer service.\n\nAnalyzing cost to supply helps businesses grasp the fundamental costs of product production and distribution, while cost to serve analysis assesses the true profitability of each customer or segment. This understanding facilitates data-driven decisions on customer prioritization and pricing strategies.\n\nRecognizing the differences between these metrics can prevent the misconception that a product or customer is profitable solely based on cost to supply. In reality, cost to serve can uncover hidden costs from complex service requirements that may diminish margins. Balancing both metrics ensures companies focus on high-value customers and avoid excessive costs for low-value ones.\n\nWith appropriate tools, businesses can efficiently monitor both cost to supply and cost to serve. Solutions like WMS and TMS enable process automation, system integration, and real-time data access for smarter decision-making. Whether handling complex logistics or enhancing customer service, these tools provide the insights and control needed to minimize unnecessary costs and boost profitability. What challenges do you face in managing your logistics costs?",

Poorly managed returns can severely impact your business, making effective return management essential, particularly in e-commerce. Two common mistakes businesses make in managing returns include: \n\n1. Treating Returns Management as Separate: Many neglect to integrate returns into their business strategy, missing out on valuable insights regarding service issues, customer preferences, and product defects.\n   \n2. Failing to Use Return Management Software: Research indicates that e-commerce businesses face return rates of 15% to 30% of total sales. Managing returns manually can waste time, money, and labor. Return management software automates 90% of the return process, significantly improving customer experience.",

After three months of job hunting, I was offered the Director of Operations position at a well-known MNC 4PL company (Company B), which significantly increased my salary. I quickly accepted and started a couple of months later. In this new role, I enjoyed luxuries like a high-performing team and minimal tasks, often working from home without issues. Over time, I felt restless again, so I contacted headhunters to explore new opportunities.\n\nI quickly landed an interview with an MNC electronics manufacturer (Company C) for the Head of Supply Chain position, which came with a 25% pay increase but required regular office hours. I devised a plan to accept the offer without resigning from Company B. For two months, I managed both roles, reporting to Company B daily while also working at Company C. My responsibilities at Company C were manageable, focusing on order processes and vendor management, which I streamlined. I leave Company C at 5 PM, return to Company B to interact with staff, and then go to Company A to handle minor tasks.\n\nNow, I juggle three incomes but am concerned about being discovered. Company B is pushing me for a Regional Senior VP role that would require relocation, which I might resign over if I can’t avoid it.

    "content": "Imagine entering a well-organized warehouse where operations run seamlessly—packages are sorted, orders are fulfilled promptly, and every team member is well-equipped with the necessary tools. Now, envision attempting to maintain that level of efficiency by merely observing security camera footage all day. Which scenario appears more effective? Businesses have various options for enhancing operations, with Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Computer Vision being two prominent choices. Here’s why investing in a WMS may be the wiser decision for your company.\n\n### Managing Costs\nCost is a critical factor when adopting new technologies. WMS generally requires an investment between $100,000 and $500,000, with straightforward maintenance and quick implementation—often within a few months. In contrast, Computer Vision demands substantial initial spending on cameras and specialized software, with ongoing maintenance that can become costly. Implementation can take up to two years due to extensive data collection and testing. WMS typically provides a return on investment within 12-18 months, while Computer Vision may take years to break even.\n\n### Enhancing Efficiency\nWMS can significantly boost warehouse operations by automating tasks and improving inventory management and order processing. While Computer Vision is useful for specific functions like quality control, it lacks the comprehensive benefits of a WMS and is often viewed as an auxiliary tool rather than a standalone solution.\n\n### Scaling with Your Business\nAs your business expands, your systems must adapt. WMS is designed to accommodate increased volume and complexity, allowing for smooth scaling. In contrast, scaling Computer Vision often involves additional hardware purchases and complex adjustments, driving up costs and implementation time. This inflexibility can hinder growth.\n\n### Utilizing Your Data\nData-driven decision-making is crucial in modern warehouses. WMS offers advanced analytics and integrates seamlessly with other systems, whereas Computer Vision mainly produces visual data that needs further processing for actionable insights. \n\n### The Superior Investment\nWhen evaluating WMS against Computer Vision, WMS emerges as the preferred option for most businesses due to its cost-effectiveness, rapid implementation, scalability, and overall operational impact. While Computer Vision has its niche applications, it lacks the comprehensive management capabilities of a WMS. Although it can provide valuable insights alongside other tools, relying solely on video footage is inadequate without proper event tracking. A fully integrated WMS effectively manages this data.\n\nFor a simpler alternative, consider a solution like Cleverence that enables quick registration of stock movements with mobile devices and barcodes, ensuring accurate tracking of operations without the complexities and costs associated with a full",

Recently, I interviewed for two similar positions: one as a Business Administrator with a successful custom chemical group and another as a Purchasing Assistant with a renowned food services company specializing in rice. After a successful phone interview for the first role, I declined an in-person interview due to accepting an offer from the second company, which is closer to home.\n\nIn the Purchasing Assistant interview, I was asked about my salary expectations and mentioned $20 an hour, though I should have asked for $25, which is my current freelance rate.

    "content": "Warehouse efficiency relies heavily on effective receiving processes, with the choice between one-stage and two-stage receiving impacting operational efficiency and automation strategies, thereby influencing supply chain responsiveness and accuracy. The decision depends on inventory characteristics and warehouse needs. One-stage receiving is best for straightforward, uniform product flows, while two-stage receiving is suited for diverse, complex inventories. Automation systems play a key role in linking physical operations with digital processes, automating tasks like scanning goods and managing quality control, which helps prevent errors and streamline operations. \n\nIn one-stage receiving, goods are sent directly to their storage location upon arrival, which is efficient for uniform products or small volumes. Warehouse staff use digital systems to quickly verify SKUs and determine storage spots, enhancing speed and space utilization. For small shipments, a location-first scanning approach is recommended, while larger ones may favor a product-first method, both aiming for efficient handling without intermediate steps.\n\nConversely, two-stage receiving involves unloading goods to a staging area for quality checks and sorting before placing them in storage. This method suits shipments with varied SKUs and supports meticulous inventory management. Cleverence can adapt to multiple receiving stages, ensuring effective handling of both small and large shipments by prioritizing either product or location based on the inventory specifics.\n\nThe decision between one-stage and two-stage receiving affects inventory accuracy and labor costs. One-stage receiving minimizes handling and potential errors, relying heavily on initial checks and automation tools for accuracy. In contrast, two-stage receiving offers more verification points to catch discrepancies early, though it can be more labor-intensive. \n\nOne-stage receiving generally incurs lower labor costs due to fewer handling steps, making it efficient for operations with limited staff. However, it demands high accuracy from the start. Two-stage receiving, while possibly more costly in labor, allows for specialization, reducing errors and improving throughput. Ultimately, the choice should consider the balance between labor savings and the risk of inaccuracies, with advanced automation systems enhancing both methods by improving data accuracy and labor efficiency.",

I have nearly 2 years of experience in supply chain, starting as a logistics coordinator at a 4PL company, where I worked with Excel and ERP. I then moved to a manufacturing company as an operations analyst in the Finance department, focusing on finance operations support. Over the past year, I’ve developed skills in cost analysis for work orders and labor reports, inventory analysis, and collaborating with Production on weekly special parts schedules. My team also handles material planning for SKUs, updates part costs in ERP based on burden and labor, and occasionally provides quotes to sales when my supervisor is absent. I've narrowed my options to two paths: advancing in supply chain (which seems limited in salary growth) or transitioning to finance or accounting. I'm unsure what direction to take, but my main motivation is adequate compensation, so I want to shape my career accordingly. Additionally, I have an engineering background and a PG diploma in Business Analytics, so I'm uncertain how pursuing a master's degree would fit in.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, what processes do you use for managing receiving errors? We primarily utilize EDI with ASN labels and create our own labels for internal purposes. We encounter two main errors: vendor errors and internal errors. Secondary errors include incorrectly tagged UPCs and mixed cases. We allow a 100% overage before the system rejects a shipment, and typically, we issue a new PO for the overage, making it difficult to catch mistakes until later. This results in many PODs from vendors, as the overage often signifies a shortage due to an error. When an error is identified, it is sent to a specific area for investigation (if we adhere to our SOP), but sometimes it is just reshelved. Currently, there is no reporting process for this, leading to inventory accuracy issues, which we then manually adjust upon discovery, creating further inventory complications. Our main software is JDA, along with a custom WMS. I'm curious about how our process compares to others. How do you receive products? How do you manage overages and shortages? What steps do you take to correct your inventory? How do you handle reshelving in your forward pick, if applicable? Do you cross-dock? How many warehouses do you operate? What software do you use? Do you rely on 3PLs for receiving, and is it done in-house or off-site?",

We have a warehouse at our new office where we store inventory for our maintenance and HVAC teams, including appliances for unit upgrades and turns. Currently, we lack an inventory management system; we only have a person using a spreadsheet, which doesn’t track who takes items or their whereabouts. I want to implement a QR-based system that allows items to be scanned out of the warehouse (indicating who took them and removing them from 'warehouse inventory') and scanned in at the property (adding to the property's 'in-use inventory'). Each maintenance team member should have individual access to link inventory to them. I also want to generate inventory reports to inform our purchasing agent about our needs. I'm unsure if QR is the best option, but it emerged from our brainstorming. I believe something similar exists, but I'm struggling to find solutions that aren't retail-focused or overloaded with unnecessary work order features, as those are managed in our PMS.

Evaluate your current inventory management expenses and the losses from inefficiencies. If your existing system costs more than it saves, it's time to reconsider. If you lack a management system and have excess stock or fail to meet demand for popular items, you are incurring losses. Aim for near 100% accuracy in order and fulfillment, which can be hard to achieve without the right tools. Relying on Excel increases the risk of errors, while barcode scanning can enhance accuracy by automating inventory updates. \n\nWhen searching for inventory software, consider industry compatibility, as different sectors have unique needs. E-commerce businesses need integrations with shopping carts, while 3PL companies require client portals. Prioritize cloud-based software for security and ease of access. You may also need hardware like barcode scanners or label printers. Easy data import and export are essential when transitioning to a new system. Look for flexible pricing plans that allow your software to grow with your business. \n\nDon't hesitate to ask for assistance when starting with a new tool; developers appreciate feedback and may provide features you haven't discovered. Integrate all your tools to streamline operations and reduce redundant tasks. \n\nEvaluate the software provider as much as the product itself. Look for flexible contract terms without long commitments or cancellation fees. Seek vendors with genuine industry expertise and proven track records. Post-sale support is vital, so assess the provider’s ability to assist you after purchase. Ensure support comes from knowledgeable staff, and consider testing their responsiveness. Zenventory offers local support and resources to assist users effectively.",

Robinson announced on September 11 that it has opened a new 400,000-square-foot logistics facility in Laredo, Texas, expanding its presence along the Mexico border to 1.5 million square feet. The facility features 154 dock doors, accommodating up to 700 trailers, making it one of Laredo's largest cross-docking centers. Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson’s vice president for Mexico, explained that typically, three trucks are needed to transport a shipment through Laredo: a Mexican carrier delivers the trailer to the border, a transfer carrier crosses it, and then the freight is transferred to a U.S. carrier. He noted that the larger cross-dock allows for immediate unloading and reduces reloading time since forklift drivers avoid unnecessary movement. If 350 loads are picked up in a day, reducing load time by 10 minutes saves nearly 60 hours total. C.H. Robinson manages over 1 million shipments annually at the Mexico-U.S. border.",

I work for a 3PL company that only handles the receipt and delivery of parcels, so our inventory turnover should be high due to our location. The DC receives numerous parcels daily that need sorting by destination. However, our outbound performance, based on timely dispatch (parcels received under 30 minutes before dispatch), is low at 80-90%. This is due to issues like missing parcels and slow loading/unloading. \n\nWe use woven bags for parcel storage because they are waterproof and prevent theft, but they create handling challenges since they aren't flat like boxes. We previously tried using boxes but reverted to bags. I'm new here and would like to understand the benefits of using boxes over bags. Using bags leads to damage as operators manually toss them from the truck, creating disorganized piles that can increase loading times. \n\nI’m considering using mobile carts instead of placing parcels on the ground. I found a container design that could accommodate various parcel shapes, but I’m unsure if it’s practical for unloading. While it facilitates quick movement in the warehouse, it doesn’t solve loading and unloading issues, and we can’t stack them high, limiting capacity. Additionally, the size of the parcel piles varies significantly based on their destination. \n\nWe have a gravity conveyor, but operators prefer throwing parcels for speed, unless they’re already grouped in baskets for scanning. However, managing baskets across the warehouse network is complicated. I'm overwhelmed with the issues we need to address and would appreciate your insights. Thank you.",

    "content": "Hi r/Logistics, I'm consulting for an organization seeking a US customs broker to manage T86 entries for ecommerce goods transported by truck across the northern border. They process about 5,000 entries daily, increasing during peak times, and ship six days a week year-round. While only a portion of these entries is available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the share of T86 entries is expected to grow as US regulations tighten. The organization is an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base, holding all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They handle a mix of regulated and non-regulated products like food, dietary supplements, and consumer goods, primarily from the US, Canada, or China. Current clearance methods include S321, T86, and both informal and formal entries. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in ecommerce who can manage bulk entry submissions via Excel or API/EDI. The commodities are stable, consisting of well-known brands with long product cycles, not from a marketplace. The goal is to launch ASAP, potentially starting next week with the right partner. They are interested only in brokers experienced with ecommerce T86, and future daily trucking opportunities may arise depending on the partner. This could be a multi-million dollar annual account for a suitable brokerage or forwarder. DM me for more details if you think you can help.",

Currently, we rely on an outdated version of MobileAsset and Connect2. Connect2 manages asset movements (check-in/check-out/in repair, etc.), while MobileAsset serves as our master inventory list with purchase dates and manufacturer details. We want to replace MobileAsset, as I'm worried it might fail. Is there software that can: • Create/print barcodes • Store all our inventory data, and • Connect with a mobile app for barcode scanning? My boss prefers not to use web-based software, so options like AssetPanda, Sortly, and AssetTiger are off the table. He also doesn't want to rely solely on Connect2. Essentially, we need a user-friendly spreadsheet-like tool to help us conduct annual inventory checks, ensuring everything is accounted for. Is there a simpler solution I'm overlooking?

With around 400 SKUs, most of which have low quantities, my inventory is consistently changing. Other departments have designated personnel for this, but it doesn't align with my area. We receive daily replenishments based on an automated system, and I need to ensure that our physical inventory matches the management system. I created a cycle count schedule to perform a full inventory count roughly every month (every 20 business days). What is a suitable frequency for cycle counts? More frequent counts lead to greater accuracy, but my time is limited due to my other responsibilities. If inventory discrepancies arise, production can be disrupted since automated replenishments won't trigger unless inventory levels drop below a certain percentage of maximum capacity (excluding broken or scrapped items).

For instance, if the sales department confirms a delivery of 50 TVs for tomorrow, the 3PL will deliver them during business hours the next day. One policy of our 3PL is that drivers do not call recipients before deliveries; they arrive and request to unload. I've learned the reasons behind this: deliveries are pre-scheduled, so recipients should be prepared at any time during the day; drivers have multiple stops, and calling may lead to specific timing requests that disrupt their routes; and reducing calls helps cut costs for the 3PL. However, I’m uncertain if this is standard for all 3PL providers. This approach frustrates me because the sales team often asks for ETAs, and I can only advise them that if a delivery is scheduled for today, recipients should be prepared at any time. The sales team believes this practice is irresponsible and harms customer experience.",

When stores need to order ice cream, the kitchen will scan the flavors being shipped. Upon delivery, the store will scan the received flavors, and when they sell a flavor, they will scan the QR code again. The QR code will help track production date and the entire process. \n\nCan an inventory management app address this? Any suggestions?

    "content": "I’ve seen some discussions on this topic, but most responses are from nearly a year ago or from less experienced individuals (I have nearly ten years). The remote job market has worsened recently, especially with layoffs (I was affected). For those who secured remote roles, what strategies helped you stand out? I’ve been refining my cover letters, but they haven’t led to interviews, despite spending hours on them. How long did it take you to land a remote position? I have substantial experience, nearly ten years in inventory management and capacity planning, including S&OP, forecasting, production planning, and informal demand planning. I’ve served as an operations manager and led teams in two roles. I excel in Excel and consistently receive positive feedback on my work. I’ve developed my own forecasting tools, worked on inventory program implementations, and have 3-4 years of SAP experience, although my production planning was primarily with industry-specific MES/APS systems or an older MRP system (QAD). I adapt quickly to new systems; for instance, I had to learn a new inventory management system on short notice to train users. My previous boss even assigned me a computer science intern due to my technical skills, including my SAP experience and complex forecasting spreadsheets. We were working on process automation before the company could no longer afford him. This reads like a resume without the numbers, right? I have strong experience but struggle with visibility. The only gap in my background is specific sourcing/vendor management. I’ve communicated with suppliers, worked on RFQs, and negotiated prices, but I haven’t held a formal vendor management role. I worry this might hinder me, yet I can’t be the only one landing jobs without every specific requirement. I previously posted in another group, and someone suggested IBP roles given my broad experience, which interests me, but I still need to stand out among many qualified candidates. I’m open to in-office work; I did so in my last job and was hybrid before that. However, I relocated to an area with a limited job market and am looking locally. Opportunities that match my skills and previous salary are primarily in healthcare, a field where I lack experience. Most positions pay significantly less than what I earned, despite having an Ivy League degree and an MBA. Living costs are high, so I can’t return to my previous salary from when I had just a few years of experience.",

I'm seeking suggestions for additional client-specific warehouse order details to set when importing Shopify orders into CargoWise. Any input would be greatly appreciated. \n\nBackground: I've adapted an existing B2B integration into a Shopify app to facilitate new client onboarding and expand its attractiveness. Naturally, order lines, consignee details, and order notes will be included in the created warehouse orders. However, I'm exploring client-specific warehouse order details. Below are the initial settings supported for upcoming CargoWise clients: \n\n- Service Level Code\n- Is Authorized To Leave flag\n- Tracking URL link template\n\nI’m curious about how organizations are utilizing certain warehouse order settings, including:\n\n- What conventions do you use for setting the Delivery Required By date?\n- Are there useful Good Handling Instructions that could simplify the picking process by making specific order details more accessible?\n\nI'm sure there are additional warehouse order details that organizations would find helpful. If you have any suggestions, please share, along with some context if possible. Thank you!",

The carrier stated that the driver needed a 36-hour reset on their ELD, and they would deliver by the following Friday, which we accepted. Upon delivery, my customer, who was present at both pickup and delivery, noticed the carrier had switched trailers without notifying us. During cross-docking, a part of a high-value machine was damaged. I had clearly instructed the carrier's dispatcher at booking that any truck or trailer changes must be communicated in advance, and the rate confirmation stated that unapproved changes would lead to non-payment. As the customer’s claim process will begin soon, I seek advice on whether I should deduct the carrier’s payment due to their non-compliance and the damages. Is it appropriate to deduct their payment, or is there a better way to handle this? Thank you for your assistance.",

    "content": "(Cross Posted) I seek advice on inventory management and consignment software. To give some background, we own an antique shop where most sales occur online across multiple platforms, including eBay, Etsy, Chairish, and Shopify. We use Sellbrite for listings but must post separately to Chairish since it doesn’t sync. Currently, we manage inventory with Sortly but want to switch to a platform that handles both inventory management and consignor tracking, as we are beginning to take on more consignments. We need software that can track consignors, match inventory to them, and store relevant documents. One option we found is ConsignCloud, which offers robust inventory tracking and consignment management but doesn’t sync with Sellbrite. This isn’t a deal-breaker, as we could still use it for tracking items and consignors while managing listings through Sellbrite. I’m posting to see if anyone has similar experiences or advice. We’ve searched for IMS/Consignment software that syncs with Sellbrite but found nothing. We’re open to suggestions for improving our consignment and inventory management, as our current system feels patchy. Ideally, we’d like a single system that can post listings, track inventory locations, and manage consignments, though we haven’t found one at a viable price. We appreciate any insights or experiences you can share. Thank you!",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I began my career in SCM Back Office with a Swiss chemical company in India. I then moved into Master Data, Analytics (mainly creating Excel reports), Supply Chain Analytics (reporting within the supply chain), and worked as a Demand and Inventory Manager (overseeing supply/demand planning and inventory). For the last few years, I've been a Global Pricing Analyst, totaling around 12 years of experience. I'm skilled in Excel (including macros), Power BI, am nearly finished learning Python, and have basic SQL knowledge. I aim to return to the supply chain field and explore advanced topics where I can utilize my analytics skills. I'm considering these options and would appreciate your insights: 1. CPIM: This would deepen my understanding of inventory management, scheduling, and planning, allowing me to enhance my role through analytics, given my background. 2. CSCP: This certification is reportedly more recognized than CPIM, but it includes topics like sourcing and logistics that I'm less interested in. Does it sufficiently cover planning and inventory management? My next role will likely focus on these areas. 3. MITx Supply Chain Management (edX): This program seems comprehensive and affordable, but I've heard it may not be highly regarded by recruiters. 4. Coursera/Other Courses: I have a year of Coursera Plus access, allowing me to take courses like Supply Chain Analytics (Rutgers) and others at no extra cost. I also have Udemy courses on SCM KPIs, inventory management, and planning that I could complete to demonstrate my knowledge in interviews. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the best path for me. Thank you!",

Many view inventory costs merely as the value of stored products, but they encompass much more, including: the value of purchased products, taxes on stored goods, purchasing taxes, labor costs, security expenses, insurance, the value of obsolete items, transportation and handling fees, and storage costs like rent and utilities, especially for temperature-controlled spaces. If you're concerned about rising inventory costs and want to manage them effectively, consider these strategies: avoid suppliers with minimum order quantities, restock only when necessary, optimize stock space, quickly eliminate outdated products even at a loss, adopt Lean Manufacturing, streamline workflows to reduce product wait times, and use Inventory Management Software. Implementing these tips can significantly lower your inventory costs and enhance your business growth.",

    "content": "After a year with inFlow, we're ready to leave. I run a small D2C airsoft brand using a 3PL, and last year we needed an MRP/inventory management solution due to tracking difficulties. With only a three-person team, a costly custom solution wasn't feasible, so I researched 15 MRP/ERP options, prioritizing a modern UI/UX and Shopify integration. We chose inFlow, paying €350/month, which is steep for us, but we hoped for a quality product. Onboarding was easy, and their label printing software is impressive.\n\nHowever, I overlooked a critical detail: imported sales orders from Shopify were sourced from random locations due to a setup issue. With only two locations—our 3PL warehouse and our office—this led to significant inventory inaccuracies, which we initially misattributed to our own errors. After five months of back-and-forth with customer support, we learned that inFlow's Shopify integration is flawed for app-based locations. They blamed our use of a third-party app, despite it being widely used and compliant with Shopify's Fulfillment API.\n\nThe main issue is that their app lacks the necessary permission scope and requires an update, which they have not prioritized. Even suggesting a simple fix was ignored. Although we requested a discount for our troubles, we were offered a mere 10% reduction and an upsell to an annual plan. A co-founder acknowledged our frustrations but offered no solutions. \n\nAdditionally, there’s a separate unresolved bug where new product categories are automatically visible to all B2B customers, necessitating manual adjustments for each account. Despite these critical flaws, the rest of the product is solid. However, the lack of support and urgency for fixes has ruined our experience. We must find a new solution, as inFlow has shown no commitment to addressing our issues. This serves as a warning to potential users: they may not address your concerns.",

Proposed tariffs by Trump on Chinese products in January may prompt manufacturers to import more goods now to avoid extra taxes once tariffs are implemented, leading to unexpected volume increases in an already tight holiday market. \n2. Trump has indicated he will influence interest rates, meaning cuts may not solely rely on economic factors but also on his preferences. This could lead to lower interest rates, increasing money circulation and freight demand. \n3. Many illegal drivers and Mexican carriers taking low-paying loads may leave the U.S. trucking system before or when Trump takes office, as ICE is expected to intensify deportation efforts, raising the likelihood of police stops. \n4. Legal immigrants may also avoid trucking due to concerns that certain violations on a CDL could jeopardize their chances of obtaining a green card or citizenship, making the risks of trucking too high compared to a regular 9-5 job, further reducing capacity. \n5. Historically, many operators exit the market during winter due to financial strain, as they are often just one breakdown away from bankruptcy.",

    "content": "### What is Automation in Inventory and Asset Management? \nEfficient inventory and asset management is crucial for businesses. Cleverence enhances these processes through technology like barcodes, auto-ID mobile devices, ERP integration, and business process automation, addressing accuracy and efficiency needs. Barcodes and auto-ID technologies reduce manual data entry errors, ensuring precise inventory levels and asset tracking. Auto-ID mobile devices streamline operations by minimizing reliance on central databases or paperwork. ERP integration is essential for seamless data management. Data capture automation digitizes information using barcode scanners or RFID readers, while business process automation (BPA) encompasses broader operational workflows, integrating various systems for improved efficiency and real-time decision-making.\n\n### Why Customers Choose Cleverence\nCleverence provides a superior solution for automating inventory and asset management, outperforming manual methods, existing ERP modules, and custom development. This chapter highlights its efficiency, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Manual Processes\n\"Manual\" processes involve human execution without automated systems, including tasks like:\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Hand-entering data into spreadsheets or databases, sometimes using barcode scanners.\n- **Manual Physical Counts:** Counting inventory by visual inspection and tallying items.\n- **Paper-Based Tracking:** Using printed documents for inventory management.\n- **Manual Reconciliation:** Comparing physical counts with recorded data.\n- **Visual Inspections:** Checking assets without digital tools.\n\nThe misconception that barcode scanners equate to automation overlooks that true automation encompasses the entire data workflow, minimizing manual intervention. Cleverence utilizes mobile devices and an app that provides real-time ERP data, allowing employees to access stock levels and task lists directly on their devices.\n\n### Cleverence vs. ERP Modules\nERP systems manage various business processes but often lack depth in auto-ID and logistics without custom development. Cleverence effectively addresses these gaps. Many ERP systems offer basic auto-ID support, limited customization, and inadequate logistics features. Customizing ERPs can be costly and time-consuming. Cleverence offers advanced auto-ID capabilities, customizable Android apps, and efficient ERP integration, enhancing system functionalities without extensive custom work.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Custom Development\nCustom development can provide tailored solutions but is resource-intensive, costly, and may lack scalability. Cleverence offers ready-to-deploy solutions that are easily integrated and scalable, avoiding the challenges of custom development. Unlike custom projects, which often exceed budgets and timelines, Cleverence uses a device license model, ensuring predictable costs and rapid implementation.\n\n### How to Sell Cleverence",

Currently, we manage inventory and payments using physical paper invoices from shipments. How can I obtain cost price, SKU, barcode, order quantity, and other details in a .CSV file from my vendors for easy import into our new POS system? Should I request invoices in .CSV format from my vendors moving forward? Is there a standard industry method for this, perhaps through an automated Purchase Order system? How can vendors ensure that I receive .CSV files via email with the necessary columns, like the barcode? What if a vendor doesn’t include all required columns? Thanks! I previously asked this on r/retail but haven't received a response. I hope to find better luck here. Thank you!",

    "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nWe're currently using Shopify for inventory management, which works well for processing credit card transactions and POS sales. However, it has its limitations. While it handles media like e-commerce software, it doesn't meet my team's needs. We require quick access to product listings and associated images based on the DBA. For instance, when a client inquires about a product, finding details and photos in Shopify without knowing the SKU is time-consuming, and downloading images on mobile is nearly impossible. We need a system that better manages media and simplifies data handling. We’ve considered using a CMS like Strapi, Contentful, or Payload to manage everything and then sync it with Shopify. Any suggestions? I’m open to a paid discussion for a more detailed implementation solution, but I’d like to gather initial thoughts first.",

My competitors (TQL, CH, Arrive) consistently secure more freight, which is fine, but their extremely low prices seem unusual. My question is whether large 3PLs sometimes risk shipping high-value cargo using trucks with only $100k cargo insurance, while a $250k insured carrier might transport for an Albanian owner-operator with just $100k insurance. If one shipment encounters an accident or theft and my insurance is inadequate, it could jeopardize my business. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue.",

This morning, 3PL contacted me about a dedicated lane opportunity paying $4.59/mile one way, or $2.29/mile with a deadhead back ($900 daily for under 200 miles with a 26' box truck), Monday to Friday. A third-party company will be the direct contact, and I need to send them photos of my truck and ID. If approved and I accept the contract, I must pay a one-time fee equal to my daily rate ($900). The 3PL rep called from their number but won't provide email verification, and I can't reach anyone by phone to confirm his identity. The third-party email had a spelling error, and I can't find their website or phone number online. The rate seems high, and the situation feels odd, yet they seem legitimate. This could be a significant opportunity for me, but I'm unsure about sending my truck and driver's license photos. The third party says they can get my W9 and insurance from 3PL, which makes me suspect. If it’s legit and I fail to meet the contract terms, how could it affect my MC? My truck has an engine light on, minor leaks, and a slight odor from patching the leaks, but they want a \"clean truck with no odor.\" The third party warned that failing to honor the contract could \"hurt my MC.\" Thanks for your help.",

I use scan guns to save barcodes, which I then download and upload to our system to check for abnormal adjustments. I know there are many improvements we can make. Here are some practices we should implement: pack line receiving/shipping, and adding more barcodes, as about 15% of our items lack vendor barcodes.

    "content": "This is probably my first time using Reddit for advice on a real-life issue (usually it's for gaming). Here’s my situation: A few months ago, I began working at a coffee roasting factory with 11 production lines, 5 roasters, 6 grinders, 3 daily shifts (plus one on weekends), and nearly 100 operators. I serve as the supply chain administrative assistant, handling daily production reports, planning support, operator clothing, invoicing, and basic inventory tracking. Recently, my boss requested that we start a tool inventory, and after learning the process, I found it outdated and very time-consuming, with no effective tracking. The last inventory was done months ago (the previous assistant was fired), and operators frequently “misplace” tools. I want to propose a new method to streamline tool inventory management and hold operators somewhat accountable. Here’s what I know: \n\n1. Each production line has a specific tool kit, with some tools for general use. \n2. Operators can carry a small bag for minor tools; they might fit more tools in there or we could provide better bags. \n3. We currently use a simple spreadsheet for inventory. \n4. I have a list of tools for each line to identify common and specific items. \n5. I lack clearance for surveillance cameras, and there’s little interest in tracking tool misplacements due to resource constraints. \n6. Missing tools are simply replaced, but my boss and the maintenance team are frustrated with this approach. \n7. Most operators have been with the company for over five years, which may help with solutions.\n\nI’m considering creating a “common tool kit” for every operator and a “specific tool kit” for each production line, but this won't fully resolve the misplacement issue. How should I approach this? What am I overlooking? I need ideas for a plan to present, as I have approval to test my proposal on one of the largest lines. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Let me know if you need more details; I'm happy to provide them. Apologies for any mistakes; English isn't my first language.",

    "content": "I've been reflecting on this and would like your input. It's clear that EVs aren't the long-term solution for vehicle power. Their batteries last only around 10 years and are costly to replace, charging infrastructure is lacking, and sourcing materials is becoming more difficult and expensive. Hydrogen seems more likely to prevail once it's proven safe and practical for consumers. So why are we offering tax incentives and other benefits for EV buyers? This frustrates me, especially since I work in supply chain. Many agree that EVs aren’t suitable for long-haul trucking due to the heavy batteries, inadequate charging infrastructure, and shorter battery life compared to diesel. Despite this, companies like Tesla continue to thrive—could it be due to Elon Musk's influence? I've come to wonder if the promotion of EVs is a strategy to curb Saudi wealth, as more EVs could mean reduced oil purchases from them. Musk has strong ties to the government and plays a key role in national security through his satellite operations. Is this support for EVs part of a broader strategy to limit financial dependency on Saudi Arabia? Today, I noticed they're finally facing financial losses, which sparked these thoughts. What do you think? EVs seem like a short-term government push with a global agenda while we seek better sustainable energy solutions.",

Our initial impressions were positive: they met our freight cost benchmarks, their portal and tracking features seem impressive, and the teams we've met have been friendly and responsive. However, after speaking with a client today who advised against using them in favor of DSV or another option, I learned that companies he knows are moving away from KN due to various service issues. This raised some concerns for me. Has anyone here had experience with KN? For context, our company fabricates industrial kitchen equipment for North American markets and is expanding into Europe, handling several LTL imports/exports from Italy monthly and about one or two full containers annually.",

I'm tasked with updating our inventory management and invoicing systems. Currently, we use SAGE (MS-DOS version), but the owner isn't very tech-savvy, so we need a simple system with online invoicing, sales tracking for future analysis, and barcode generation. It should be accessible from our computers and tablets via the cloud. We also want to transition from paper invoicing to emailing customers, which can be completed on-site using the tyre fitters’ devices. If you know of any systems that meet these needs or a tyre-specific solution, that would be ideal. Thanks!",

We currently rely on temporary staff to enter high volumes of wine sample data into Excel (supplier, varietal, vintage, etc.). I want a more efficient, scalable system, ideally one that uses barcode scanning and cataloging. However, some samples lack barcodes (due to supplier labels or tank samples). Requirements: Ability to scan bottles with barcodes to log their details, including inventory date and storage location, and create a catalog (similar to a spreadsheet of samples); ability to manually enter non-barcode samples (preferably with a feature to print unique barcodes for easy scanning out); ability to scan out samples sent to customers to track receipt and dispatch details.

    "content": "Inventory is essential for retail businesses, and effective management is crucial. Poor inventory management is a leading cause of small business failures, often due to a series of errors resulting in poor decisions. In competitive markets with tight margins, small businesses cannot afford such mistakes. Overestimating demand leads to excess inventory, incurring storage costs and risking spoilage or obsolescence, while underestimating frustrates customers who may seek alternatives. Accurate demand forecasting is challenging, but without current and precise data, success is unlikely. Many small business owners still rely on pen-and-paper or spreadsheets for inventory tracking, which is prone to data-entry errors causing costly shipping mistakes and flawed forecasting. \n\nPoint-of-sale software offers accuracy, but small businesses hesitate to invest in technology like barcode scanners or RFID tags. If inventory data is inaccurate, resource planning becomes ineffective. Although inventory software can be costly, competitive software vendors provide appealing solutions for small businesses. Cloud-based inventory software enables real-time stock visibility across multiple locations, with dashboards for easy information visualization accessible from PCs or mobile devices. It can integrate with ERP systems for improved forecasting and support online sales, allowing customers to check product availability.\n\nAs retailers grow, cloud-based software can adapt seamlessly to new shippers or scanning systems. While these systems are user-friendly post-setup, deciding on features and integration can be complex. Modern omnichannel strategies require diverse technologies for mobility, social media, logistics, and analytics, often beyond the capacity of typical retail IT teams, leading to increased outsourcing. Effective inventory management is vital for retail success. Retailers are investing in cloud-based software and expert assistance to improve systems, using a combination of barcode and RFID technologies to enhance forecasts and reduce costs.",

    "content": "I have a question about managing inventory for a central warehouse servicing multiple retail stores based on their total sales. Specifically, how should I determine the reorder point (ROP) for the warehouse? Should the ROP consider only the warehouse's inventory levels, or should it also include the combined inventory of all the retail stores? Would this differ if the warehouse functions as a cross-docking facility versus a break-bulk facility? I appreciate any insights on this! Thank you! Edit: Thanks for the responses. I might not have been clear in my initial post, so let me provide an example: In our system, a planner sets minimum and maximum inventory levels for both the warehouse and individual stores, which are tracked in our ERP system. Store levels are based on their demand, while the warehouse levels reflect total store demand. Orders are placed when the warehouse reaches a ROP calculated as follows: 1. Daily Demand: Total expected usage from forecasts. 2. Anticipated Lead Time: Supplier to warehouse plus warehouse to stores. 3. Safety Stock: (Z × σLT × DD avg) or another formula as needed. When the net available quantity (on-hand inventory – committed inventory + current replenishment) hits the ROP, an order should be placed. My question is: Should the warehouse order based on its own net available quantity or the combined net available quantity of both the warehouse and stores? For instance: Warehouse ROP: 20; Warehouse net available quantity: 20; Warehouse + stores net available quantity: 120. Should an order be placed because the warehouse's net available quantity reached the ROP, or should no order be placed since the combined quantity is well above the ROP?",

Given the developments in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to investigate how consumer preferences for sustainability impact last-mile delivery. 57% of consumers are interested in sustainable delivery options, and an impressive 99% are willing to take further steps to lower their carbon footprint. However, 89% mentioned that economic factors, such as inflation, influence their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Notably, 37% now consider convenience and sustainability equally important when selecting delivery methods. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which bundle multiple orders into fewer trips to reduce emissions and costs, with 56% of respondents open to this approach. This could be a crucial innovation for last-mile providers to support environmental efforts while effectively managing costs. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector adapting to achieve sustainability goals amid cost challenges? Are there new technologies or processes helping you find this balance? I’d love to hear your insights! 🙌 If you want to explore the full study, you can find it here:",

Although I aced all three tests in my second interview, I haven't received any feedback, making me wonder if I wasted my time. I'm now looking for other opportunities but don't know much about companies in this field. I've seen mentions of MLMs or \"devil corps\" on Reddit, which I'd like to avoid. Maybe a 3PL could be a good fit, but I'm unaware of any in my area. If anyone has recommendations for reputable companies or advice on how to proceed, I’d greatly appreciate it. I’m feeling a bit lost.",

    "content": "I have spent the last ten years in logistics, beginning as a bike messenger at a courier company in 2014. I progressed through various office roles, including dispatch, operations management, business development, and account management, gaining experience in Ops/Sales for both asset-based and 3PL networks, covering services like expedited parcel, LTL, and air cargo. Working at a smaller company with around 30 office staff and 100 drivers made me feel significant in my role. After reaching a plateau at the courier company, I pursued an associate degree and advanced certification in Supply Chain Management & Logistics in 2020, graduating in 2022. I then became an Account Manager at a midsized Freight Brokerage, focusing on customer relations in a split model brokerage. However, following our acquisition by a larger firm, I experienced a disillusioning environment marked by frequent policy changes, high turnover, and cultural clashes. While I perform well, I now feel like a “smaller fish in a bigger pond.” Despite my success, I am burned out trying to establish myself as a newer freight broker in a challenging market, working over 50 hours a week without clear opportunities for growth or adequate compensation (around $70k). Job openings at my company are scarce, and I am considering exploring roles outside logistics. I excel at spreadsheets and data analysis (having an advanced Excel certification) and am interested in automation/AI, believing I’d thrive in analyst or purchasing roles. Although I have succeeded in sales and management, I’m not keen on returning to management. Living in Chicago’s Southside, I prefer remote work but am open to hybrid or in-person roles, aiming to maintain a salary of at least $70k. My community college certification followed the ASCM syllabus, and while I’ve considered pursuing a CLDT or CSCP, I’m uncertain about their relevance to my current situation. I would appreciate your insights on potential roles, industries, or companies that align with my skills and experience.",

    "content": "I work for a small retail business that sells both in-store and online, frequently ordering products from various suppliers. Upon receiving items, I contact them for a spreadsheet with barcode numbers, style numbers, colors, sizes, titles, descriptions, and available images. I can’t be the only retailer making such requests, especially with many people listing products online or using inventory systems that require this information. It's common to see identical descriptions and titles across different websites, indicating wholesalers provide the same details to retailers. Yet, when I reach out, representatives often seem surprised by my request, needing multiple transfers to possibly locate a “download as .xlsx or .csv” option for my order. Why is this process so cumbersome? Surely larger retailers like Walmart don’t manually copy product details for every new item. While I'm aware of EDI systems that automate inventory for big companies, I don’t think I need one to obtain a simple spreadsheet for my small business. Currently, I’m manually entering about 90% of the required information, typing style numbers without digital invoices, or copying them from invoices one at a time, then scanning barcodes as items arrive. Each supplier has its own procedures, making it hard to track them all—some provide a master product spreadsheet via Dropbox, others offer just a digital invoice or packing slip. Every supplier presents a unique challenge. There must be a more efficient way to handle this.",

This option eliminates the need for fulfillment software, warehouse space, shipping interfaces, and additional staff. Ensure you understand your budget and business needs before selecting a suitable 3PL.\n\n3. **Dropshipping**: If you don’t stock or manufacture products, consider dropshipping. This method relies on manufacturers to produce, store, and ship products directly to customers.\n\n4. **Utilize Integration Solutions**: To fulfill orders quickly, maintain visibility across logistics, sales, and inventory. Real-time access to data is essential, and integrating platforms like your website, inventory system, shopping cart, warehouse management, CRM, and accounting software is crucial for meeting customer expectations.\n\n5. **Understand Your Cost Per Order**: Longer fulfillment times typically lead to higher costs due to disconnected systems, resulting in repeated data entry and comparisons across various applications.\n\n6. **Minimize the Impact of Order Returns**: Facilitating easy returns is vital for customer satisfaction in a competitive market.

    "content": "In 2020, modern businesses have recognized the necessity of inventory management software for running an efficient phone repair shop. In a competitive market, repair store owners cannot afford to waste money. Let's explore common inventory management challenges and how POS software can help address them. \n\nChallenge 1: Unknown Inventory \nUnderstanding essential versus non-essential items and their ordering timelines is crucial. Essential items are those that are popular or sold year-round and require constant restocking. Identifying core items is just the start; you must also know what’s in stock, what needs ordering, and what requires restocking. Managing inventory can be overwhelming but is essential for profitability, and a quality POS system can assist greatly.\n\nChallenge 2: Manual Inventory Tracking \nMany businesses begin with manual inventory tracking, like spreadsheets. However, this method becomes problematic for larger businesses with multiple outlets, leading to unreliable real-time information and inaccurate counts. Such inaccuracies can result in excess or insufficient inventory, causing customer dissatisfaction. Automating through POS software is the optimal solution, providing real-time tracking, low-stock alerts, inventory counts, reorder notifications, and quick purchase orders.\n\nChallenge 3: Decentralized Inventory Records \nCentralizing inventory allows management from one location for all repair stores, enhancing control over operations like reordering and receiving. This efficiency simplifies managing multi-channel orders and inventory levels, improving customer experience through accurate product information and stock availability.\n\nChallenge 4: Lack of Transparency \nIBM reports that 79% of store owners find lack of transparency significantly impacts profits. Today’s businesses prioritize transparency in operations, ensuring employees and customers are informed about item statuses. Even with solid inventory strategies, issues may arise, so keeping customers updated on order delays can adjust their expectations and maintain confidence. Clear communication is vital, including notifying customers when items are back in stock.\n\nThe Solution: Cloud-Based Inventory Management & Repair Store Software \nAn effective inventory management system is now a reality. If you haven't selected a POS software for your repair store, consider investing in automated inventory control to eliminate manual tasks and enhance efficiency. A smart inventory management solution provides real-time data access, enabling valuable insights for better forecasting and streamlining processes—making inventory management simpler through automation.",

I've worked on both the 3PL/freight brokerage side and the customer side, and it's been quite a journey. As an account coordinator at a 3PL, the workload is intense, with overwhelming emails and last-minute issues. Larger 3PLs provide some work-life balance by having specific teams manage after-hours problems, while smaller brokerages expect near-constant availability. I earned about $64K, but the stress and off-hours calls were draining. On the customer side, being a logistics specialist is less intense. In smaller companies, the workload was manageable, and I rarely worked late or outside regular hours, but the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. Although the role is more relaxed, it falls short of my $100K salary goal without moving into rare managerial roles. I also explored customs clearance, which involves constant updates and issues but offers little financial improvement. Overall, logistics is a challenging, undervalued field, and the pay reflects that. It’s tough to find well-paying roles without excessive hours.

Initially, I felt slightly disappointed as it was 2-3% below my expectations, but after some research, I realized it aligns with market rates for someone with my 6-7 years of supply chain experience, including 4 years as a supervisor. The job title \"Procurement and S&OP Manager\" (managing two others and about 10 indirect employees) seems more valuable than the salary itself. I’m 31, working for a Forbes 500 company in the EU, and will have significant responsibilities, such as collaborating with senior managers and overseeing the inventory for my business unit, which includes managing a $30 million stock and a $6-7 million logistics budget across two EMEA distribution centers, with annual sales of $250 million and new product introductions. My past experience includes leading a remote team of buyers, owning supply chain processes, implementing SAP, and relocating production and distribution. In the future, I plan to implement a new business planning tool. I aim to advance my career, and many companies are seeking candidates with S&OP management experience. While I’m not trying to boast, I do seek validation that I’m on the right path and that this role will provide further opportunities.",

The pickup occurred last Wednesday via a transport company I've used frequently, with delivery on Thursday and a POD received by Monday morning. However, my customer emailed at noon saying not all goods were received. After some discussion, the trucking company informed me that the warehouse only loaded the 7 skids for AWB B onto the truck, claiming that the driver presented both AWBs. The trucking company blames the warehouse for not loading the correct pallets, while the warehouse is unresponsive. Since I live across the country, I can't verify the loading. Whose responsibility is this: the trucking company, the warehouse, or neither? Additionally, I might be misusing terms; the trucking company operates as a logistics provider that contracts smaller carriers. Is that considered a brokerage, logistics, or 3PL?",

Since the company is just starting out, there are no established processes or systems, and I want to set up a strong foundation for future growth. I lack inventory experience, so this is my first time handling such responsibilities. \n\nThe business needs to assemble about 5-10 large products each month, using approximately 40 pieces of raw materials for each finished product. While this volume is manageable, it is expected to grow quickly. Therefore, I need a system to track inventory, including beginning inventory, purchases, work in progress, finished goods, and ending inventory. I am considering a barcoding system with SKUs to streamline this process. With around 40-50 types of raw materials, I can assign barcodes to each location. At the end of each day or week, an employee can scan the barcodes and log the quantities, allowing for easy conversion to a spreadsheet or system. I’m looking for feedback on this idea, as I believe it could simplify inventory management and reduce manual counting.\n\nWhile I am proficient in Excel and can start tracking inventory there, I believe that for long-term success and growth, it would be beneficial to implement dedicated inventory software.

    "content": "Hello everyone, I’m digitizing the inventory and order management system for a small vegetable warehouse currently using paper. They supply vegetables to schools and smaller institutions, with many recurring clients. I’m seeking software suggestions to streamline operations. Here’s a brief overview of the requirements and a typical scenario: \n\nBackground: I’m mainly a frontend developer and can customize a solution's frontend as needed. I’ve thought about building a system from scratch using a headless CMS like Strapi, but I’m also looking for simpler options. I’ve reviewed systems like Odoo and ERPNext but welcome additional recommendations.\n\nRequirements: \n1. Self-Hosted or Local: Must operate locally on a PC or be self-hosted. \n2. Inventory Management: Should manage stock like 250 kg of potatoes, 40 kg of tomatoes, etc. \n3. Order Management: Need to easily create phone orders in the system. \n4. Recurring Clients: Must save client info for automatic invoice inclusion. \n5. Invoice Generation: System should produce detailed invoices post-checkout, including items, quantities, prices, and custom fields. \n6. Printing Capability: Should allow direct printing of invoices. \n7. Ease of Use: Must be user-friendly for those with minimal tech skills. \n8. Open Source and Cost-Effective: Preferably open-source for customization without ongoing costs.\n\nScenario Example: An order is received by phone. The operator inputs the details (e.g., 250kg of potatoes, 40kg of tomatoes, 10kg of onions), then checks out, resulting in an invoice that lists all items, prices, and client-specific information. I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share, especially regarding similar systems.",

    "content": "I have a question and need some advice. I run a small business that ships freight daily, spending around $20,000 monthly. When an order is ready, I request quotes from my 3PL partners and direct carriers, choose the best offer, and receive a BOL. Recently, I've considered handling this myself. My main roles are in sales and operations, while my partner manages finances. I often spend time following up on freight quotes and issues. I wonder if I could take an entry-level sales job with a company like XPO or R&L, then become a customer to ship our freight at lower rates. Alternatively, could I register as a broker, cold call carriers to reduce our costs, and possibly gain extra business? Or should I just stick to my current process? Freight is a significant expense, and I want to lower it. I'm also seeking a flexible side gig, ideally one based on commission, given that I already do cold calling for my own business. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

He has the green slip ownership and is aware of the associated freight, taxes, and fees but is unaware of the complexities involved in shipping and importing a commercial vehicle to Mexico.

Returning or selling the vehicle isn't an option; he is determined to ship it but needs guidance. He’s considering: 1. Finding a local company in Hamilton/Toronto/Niagara to handle everything. 2. Shipping from a Canadian port, like Halifax or Quebec/Montreal, which would require further transport to the Pacific coast. 3. Driving the truck into the U.S. (e.g., New York State) for an American company to pick it up, though he wants to avoid driving it across the U.S. and Mexico. He is looking for recommendations on the best approach or freight companies that specialize in this type of shipment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Start by outlining how you plan to use the 3PL, such as for FBA prep or multi-channel fulfillment. After determining your needs, contact potential 3PLs to discuss your requirements and pricing. \n\nHow to choose a 3PL provider? When selecting a fulfillment partner, consider your supply chain factors, such as product sources, packaging, and daily shipping volume. Look for a partner that can reduce costs and has strong shipping carrier relationships, especially if you plan to fulfill through multiple channels. \n\nIs 3PL right for your business? If you want to outsource distribution and fulfillment, 3PLs can help grow your online business by enabling multi-channel sales and secure inventory storage. It's essential to perform a cost analysis and assess their reliability in fulfilling commitments.",

Additionally, as autonomous trucking advances, brokers may become obsolete, though I don't expect this change for another 20 years.

We have an office and a warehouse filled with LVP flooring, glue, self-leveler, used appliances, HVAC parts, pipes, and miscellaneous items. We're starting to keep parts in-house for our turnover and maintenance teams, but we're having trouble organizing them in the AppFolio software we use. Vendors and technicians can easily grab what they need and either text me or leave a note. I check the inventory weekly, but the counts often don't match. For example, vendors might text requesting a certain number of flooring boxes, and when I bill them, I discover they've taken fewer than requested, leading to shortages. We clearly need a new system, and I'm trying to figure it out. I've considered a paper system where they sign out items, but I worry about honesty since there are no cameras in the area. Thank you.",

    "content": "I had nearly three years without fraud issues, which I took pride in. However, I recently let my guard down and faced a situation involving freight theft, though I managed to prevent it before any significant consequences arose. Unfortunately, a reputable carrier became a victim of a fraudulent FreightGuard report on Carrier411, damaging their business. Here's the account with evidence: We had a reefer load from NE to TX, and my operations guy received a call from VOKHID TRANSPORTATION (MC 1226568 DOT 3573700). They provided the driver's name, phone number, truck, and trailer, all necessary for check-in at the shipper. Although something felt off, the driver accepted tracking, and my ops guy confirmed the ETA. The driver checked in at the shipper (drop trailer) but faced delays. The next morning, when he tried to retrieve the trailer, there was confusion over the trailer number, raising suspicions. However, since the truck and driver matched, I decided to monitor the situation closely. An hour later, I noticed the truck heading West instead of South and called the driver. During our conversation, I discovered the driver wasn't affiliated with GOSMART, and the dispatcher had received a rate confirmation from THOR XPRESS 3PL (MC 601820), which was a victim of identity theft. I spoke with someone there to confirm my findings and provided documentation to help them resolve the issue. The driver also received a call from a fraudster impersonating Thor Xpress, claiming the load had changed to deliver to Target in Fontana, CA, with cash payment at delivery. After some questioning, he provided the company name JDS Trans (MC 870454). I contacted JDS Trans, informed them of the situation, and they sent over documentation from the fraudster, enabling us to set them on the right path. We prevented the load theft, but soon after, they received a FreightGuard report from ACE TRUCKLOAD, LLC, attributed to a Jane Watson, claiming they had stolen freight and requested payment. The report included a non-working number and another that led to someone who couldn't confirm Jane Watson's existence. After following up with ACE Truckload, I learned they had the report removed, suspecting their Carrier411 account was hacked. I emailed the address on the report but haven't received a response. Notably, the fraudster had been posting the load on DAT since 10/28, before our load was posted",

I've requested DDP shipping costs from these suppliers, yet since we're receiving multiple cartons from different locations, I believe it would be more cost-effective to consolidate shipments through a single Freight Forwarder in one city. This way, we can reduce shipping costs before sending them to our 3PL, which also charges fees per pallet or carton. I've contacted several Freight Forwarders on Alibaba, in China, and in Australia, but their rates vary significantly. For a consolidated shipment of 200kg, I'm seeing quotes ranging from $1 to $10/kg, with some quotes reaching up to $2000. The $10/kg seems excessive, especially since individual shipments are cheaper. I've been advised to choose Freight Forwarders based where I am located rather than where I'm importing from. Should I opt for Chinese or Australian Freight Forwarders? If I select those from Alibaba, how can I ensure their legitimacy?

This approach helps reduce waste and lowers carbon emissions linked to production and disposal.\n\nThe European Returnable Packaging Market has been steadily growing due to regulatory measures, consumer awareness, and corporate commitment to sustainability. Industry reports predict strong growth in the market as returnable packaging becomes more widely adopted across sectors.\n\nKey growth drivers include:\n\n- **Environmental Awareness:** Increased concern over issues like plastic pollution and climate change has prompted a shift toward returnable packaging as a solution.\n- **Regulatory Initiatives:** European governments have enacted strict regulations to limit single-use plastics, fostering a favorable environment for returnable packaging.\n- **Cost Savings for Businesses:** Although the initial cost of returnable packaging may be higher, long-term savings from reduced waste and shipping costs are encouraging businesses to adopt this approach.\n- **Supply Chain Efficiency:** Returnable packaging improves supply chain efficiency by cutting waste and reducing the need for frequent replenishment of packaging materials, appealing especially to complex supply chains.\n\nHowever, challenges persist in the market:\n\n- **Initial Investment Barriers:** The upfront costs for durable, reusable materials can deter smaller companies with limited capital.\n- **Logistical Complexities:** Implementing a returnable packaging system requires careful logistics for the collection, cleaning, and redistribution of materials, which can be a hurdle for transitioning businesses.\n- **Consumer Education:** Despite growing environmental awareness, some consumers may not fully understand the benefits of returnable packaging, necessitating educational efforts for broader acceptance.\n\nInnovations and trends include:\n\n- **Smart Packaging Solutions:** Technologies like RFID tags and sensors are enhancing tracking and monitoring of packaging assets, improving system efficiency.\n- **Collaborative Efforts:** Companies are increasingly sharing resources, such as pallet pools and container exchanges, to maximize the advantages of returnable packaging.\n- **Material Innovation:** Advances in materials, including biodegradable plastics and innovative composites, are being explored to minimize environmental impact.\n- **Circular Economy Integration:** Emphasizing reusable and recyclable products aligns well with returnable packaging principles, and many companies are",

They process about 5,000 entries daily, increasing during peak times, and ship six days a week year-round. While only a portion of these entries is available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the share of T86 entries is expected to grow as US regulations tighten. The organization is an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base, holding all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They handle a mix of regulated and non-regulated products like food, dietary supplements, and consumer goods, primarily from the US, Canada, or China. Current clearance methods include S321, T86, and both informal and formal entries. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in ecommerce who can manage bulk entry submissions via Excel or API/EDI. The commodities are stable, consisting of well-known brands with long product cycles, not from a marketplace. The goal is to launch ASAP, potentially starting next week with the right partner. They are interested only in brokers experienced with ecommerce T86, and future daily trucking opportunities may arise depending on the partner. This could be a multi-million dollar annual account for a suitable brokerage or forwarder. DM me for more details if you think you can help.",

Barcode scanners are vital for quickly capturing product information, ensuring accurate inventory management, and streamlining tasks like receiving and shipping. The scanner's environment influences your choice; rugged models are needed for industrial settings, while lighter ones suit retail. Consider battery life to ensure it lasts an entire shift, and check connectivity options for seamless integration with your network. Performance in speed and accuracy is crucial, as is the device's ergonomics for user comfort during extended use.\n\nOdoo's limited hardware support complicates this selection, often recommending pre-configured Zebra devices. However, not all scanners integrate well, so it's important to choose compatible devices. An effective alternative for Chrome users is third-party software like Cleverence Warehouse 15, which enhances compatibility and functionality. Cleverence supports a wider range of Android barcode scanners, ensuring smooth integration with Odoo Inventory and improving real-time data management.\n\nCleverence also offers advanced features for tracking serial and batch numbers, optimizing storage, and streamlining operations.

Installers are supposed to notify the owner via email when they use items from their trucks.\n- Customer jobs are billed periodically as portions are completed, meaning goods leaving the warehouse don't immediately update inventory in QuickBooks.\n\nIn summary, we lack inventory management software, and items can be in six locations at once (excluding job sites with unbilled goods). Is the solution just implementing inventory management software? If so, what would you recommend? The company is growing quickly, with plans for more installers, vehicles, and a second warehouse in the next two years. Thank you for any advice!",

    "content": "I am currently working at a local business office, handling various tasks and researching solutions. Lately, I've been looking into inventory management apps, aiming for an affordable option that supports mobile scanning. I found one that seemed promising after preparing to input all the UPC codes. However, my boss believed this app would automatically scan UPCs and populate item details, which is not the case. To my knowledge, no inventory app offers this feature because the information must be initially provided. While it’s possible to create a custom app that cross-references UPCs on eBay, that would likely be costly. My question is: Does an app exist that auto-fills item information instead of requiring manual entry?",

I work for a company that sells sports gear online and in two retail locations. We also have a partner with an Amazon store that carries our brand, sourcing products from our warehouse, which has led to some issues. We lack a solid inventory tracking system, resulting in situations where our partner sells items we don't have, often without prior notice. My boss and he are looking for software to track product quantities across our two retail locations, one Shopify store, and one Amazon store. Additionally, the items we need to track currently don't share matching SKUs online. I can address that but prefer software that can handle one item with multiple SKUs. Furthermore, I don't think our retail products have proper barcodes for scanning, so any advice on that would be appreciated. I apologize if this is overwhelming or seems impossible; I inherited this from someone less informed, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I’m happy to answer any follow-up questions as I may have left out details. Thank you!",

I managed one retail store for 10 years and oversaw the other businesses for about 5-6 years. We sold everything in 2022, and I took an accounting manager position at a 3PL company that operates four warehouses along the East Coast and has a trucking division mainly focused on transporting containers from ports to our warehouses. Additionally, I assist a C-suite officer in managing a new sugar import business, where we import and resell sugar in the U.S. My primary focus is on costing and accounting. Although I'm skilled in accounting, I don’t enjoy it and don’t see a future at my current small company. I've heard that supply chain (SC) is a promising field, and that my skills in accounting, operations management, and procurement would be applicable. However, my job applications haven't been successful lately. Recently, I secured an interview for a buyer position at a major food distributor in the Philly area. I seek advice on how to present my experience for this role, as I feel slightly overqualified but hope to grow in a large company. The Glassdoor salary range for a buyer there is $55k-90k, and I’m targeting $75-80k—does that seem reasonable?",

My role involves receiving tenders from clients, building loads in our systems, and posting loads on platforms like DAT to find carriers. I negotiate rates and send rate confirmations, but I don’t track carriers; that’s handled by check callers who monitor GPS and handle inquiries. They report any issues to my boss and me. If clients have questions or need assistance while my boss is unavailable, I address those. I also schedule pickups and deliveries via email or various TMS, and I close loads after verifying the PODs. My boss and I essentially perform the same daily tasks, but I don't seek new clients; those are assigned to us by the accounts manager once agreements are made. Can I list \"broker\" on my resume, or is there more I need to learn to qualify as one?

I have an idea to streamline our warehouse inventory and would like your feedback. Currently, we use ServiceTitan for all our needs (inventory, estimates, sales, client communication) and rely on pen and paper to inform our warehouse manager about additional parts stocked on our vans. He conducts periodic paper inventory checks. I'm considering a program to replace this system with a process involving barcodes, Google Forms, and Excel. The plan is for technicians to scan a QR code that leads to a Google Form with a list of parts, allowing them to photograph the barcode of the part they’re taking. This data would then populate an Excel file to track additional inventory beyond ServiceTitan. Is this an overly complicated idea, or could it work and has it been done before? I welcome both positive and negative feedback, technical terms, and any extra suggestions. Thank you for your help, and I’m happy to offer HVAC advice in return.",
