Air freight will be your easiest option but you will need to check aircraft size before packing your pallets as there maybe size and weight restrictions. \n\nYou could try Vanguard or AGS for LCL options as they may have road onforwarding services through Mali. \n\nOr work backwards and use someone like AGL Niger. They have an agent network and can arrange all the way through and will sort customs clearance for you. \nhttps://www.aglgroup.com/en/transport-logistics-africa/niger/\n\nYour documentation will need to be correct for the import. This is where most people have issues when shipping into West Africa. Also make sure you understand duty and taxes % so you don\u2019t get caught out. Request a DDP rate. (Delivered Duties Paid)\n\nGood luck",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm about to meet with a UPS sales rep to discuss shipping rates. We require daily pickups in Miami to send packages nationwide, estimating 700 to 1000 shipments monthly, primarily for next-day delivery, but we also need 3-day and 5-day options. I would appreciate your insights on securing the best rates. What discounts or special deals can I negotiate with UPS? Besides price, what should I consider, such as reliability or customer service? I'm also curious about what UPS values in a customer like me\u2014just volume, long-term commitment, or other factors? Any advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

They are resellers who will over you subpar service. \n\nUnless it is a space issue, you do not need two pickups a day. UPS only sorts overnight, nothing is moving until then regardless of when it is picked up. \n\nBe prepared to share your current invoices with UPS so they can get you a more competitive rate. They will definitely be interested in all that air. UPS pricing is typically tiered based on your spend. They'll give you a better rate based on your expected spend over 12 months. \n\nSource: I was a UPS rep for 5+ years.",

It is always better to work directly, our reps told us there is no direct contact if we use a 3PL and we\u2019ve definitely had moments where it was critical especially when it comes to the next day or other critical shipments, which it sounds like you might have. Never commit to large increases in volume if you play both sides tho. \n\nLike the other commenter said only one pickup is probably sufficient. Those trucks fit quite a bit inside them if you think you'll overload them. We shipped 600 individual parcels via UPS on Friday and just had our rep send over a box truck. \n\nAlso, I don't know if it's like this for all their customers but our LTL and parcel reps are always sending over pizza on Fridays. See if you can get them to swing those.",

The books will arrive in 15 boxes, each weighing about 9kg and measuring around 25 cm. The printer lacks experience with shipping to the USA, and I\u2019m unfamiliar with the import process. I want to send these books to residential addresses in the USA by air while minimizing customs fees. Since this is a group purchase and the books will be shared among family members, I think it might be best to have the printer issue 4 separate invoices and ship 3 or 4 boxes to 4 different family addresses. This way, each shipment would fall under the $800 de minimis threshold, potentially easing customs issues. Is this a good plan? Any other recommendations? Thanks!",

By standardizing contracts and establishing markets, futures exchanges create stability in industries with erratic pricing. Could this approach also benefit the broader shipping industry, including truck, ship, air, and rail freight? As an economics student, I wonder if freight rate futures could provide income stability for operators when rates fall below cost levels. I've noted average rates on sites like DAT Trendlines for trucking and assume other sectors experience similar challenges in managing operational costs and financial obligations. Futures contracts might be a viable solution. I would appreciate any insights on how this could apply to logistics and supply chain sectors. Thank you for your time!",

A lumber supply store in my hometown was bought a few years ago and has since declined, with contractors avoiding it due to poor management rather than the staff. I see an opportunity here as I want to enter local/short-haul trucking. The nearest city with better resources is 1.5-2 hours away, making supply runs time-consuming for contractors. I'm considering getting a tractor/trailer (likely a flatbed) to make weekly supply runs. Contractors can compile a list of needed materials, and I can pick them up and return. To address urgent needs, I plan to create a small lumber yard with common materials so contractors can save time. This would also serve as a staging area for pickups or deliveries with a smaller truck. My goal isn't to profit significantly but to support the contractors, as they're vital to the community's progress. However, I need to ensure enough participation to make this viable. Regarding pricing, trucking typically charges by the mile, but that may not cover my costs effectively. I anticipate doing vocational trucking as well, so this won't be my primary income source. I also consider charging a small fee for material storage, but I'm unsure how to approach pricing and would appreciate any advice or ideas. Thank you!",

This pricing is similar to how are customers are charging their client, so both parties can easily calculate and add their own margins. In your case, this would be more of a dedicated lane. Figure out the cost of handling this trip, vehicle maintenance, plate sticker, insurance, fuel, driver pay, waiting time, etc. once you know the minimum cost then you can calculate how you want to charge. If CPM structure makes sense then go for it. \n\nAlso besides service you will need to have a way to track orders, how you want to receive orders (same day request? Orders after 2pm?..etc), billing/invoice, dry run fees (accessories charges), maybe some products need to be handled with more labor and you need to add additional charges for handling. Insurance, damages, risk mitigation plans need to be thought of before they happen. Stolen/lost goods. I started off in a similar way. Good luck! it will take lots of dedication to grow if you can find a solid market to cater to.",

                "content": "This is actually a good question so I'm not sure why it was downvoted....\n\nFirst off, you need to ask the question that all college students need to ask themselves.  What are you going to do with your degree?  What are your career options with Modern Languages?  (It's a legitimate question and not intended to sound snarky.)  Now ask what your career options are with a degree in Supply Chain / Logistics.  Which of those paths appeals to you more?\n\nIf you look at the schools with the best Supply Chain Management / Logistics programs, they aren't the Ivy league schools.  Some of the top programs in the US include: Arkansas, Auburn, Michigan St and Penn St.\n\nIt's not so much the name itself that will help start your career.  A top program often has the networking and connections to solid employers who visit campus for recruiting.  When I found out my alma mater had a Top 5 program, I started making the recruiting trips and established a solid relationship.\n\nI'm not saying that only the top rated programs have those connections.  If you're looking at another school, look into their relationship with the business community.  Is there a good pipeline to help you find internships and your first job or is that all on your shoulders?  There are a couple smaller universities where I live that have great relationships with employers and I volunteer my time to mentor whenever possible.",

However, we lack a clear overview of responsibilities, which can lead to frustration and mistakes, particularly during the transition between teams. The main issue is determining when logistics should take over. I believe it should be when the supplier confirms that an item is ready for collection, ideally with a clear volume indicated, as logistics would then manage the process (most items are purchased ex works). Others think that logistics should start once the purchase order is placed and handle the supplier from that point. I would appreciate any insights, experiences, or frameworks you might have.

                "content": "Hey there - That's quite a wide question but here is some info I think will help.\n\nWhen considering transporting goods by land, air, and sea as a private carrier on a global scale, licensing and certification requirements will vary significantly depending on the country and jurisdiction you're operating in. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what you might need to consider worldwide for each mode of transportation, emphasizing how requirements can change based on the country or region.\n\n\n\nLand Transport (Private Carrier by Truck)\n\nIn most countries, if you\u2019re a private carrier transporting your own goods and not offering freight services for hire, the licensing and regulatory requirements tend to be lighter than those for for-hire carriers. However, certain regulations still apply:\n\nCommon Requirements (which vary by country):\n\nVehicle Registration: Commercial vehicles used for transporting goods must be registered with the relevant authority. In countries like the U.S., USDOT numbers are required for interstate commerce, whereas in the EU, a company must register under the European Union Road Transport Regulation.\n\nDriver\u2019s License: Typically, drivers of heavy commercial vehicles will need a Commercial Driver\u2019s License (CDL) or the local equivalent, such as an HGV license in the UK or C+E Category licenses in the EU.\n\nWeight and Fuel Taxes: In some regions, such as the EU or Canada, vehicles operating across borders may require additional registrations like the International Registration Plan (IRP) or International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) in North America, but other countries may have their own systems or requirements.\n\nCountry-Specific Regulations: For instance, Brazil and other Latin American countries may have regional rules for road transport, particularly when it comes to taxation and cargo insurance, which can be quite strict. Countries like India may require permits for certain states when transporting goods across state lines.\n\nHazardous Materials Transport: Countries that are members of the United Nations\u2019 Dangerous Goods Regulations will often require special permits and driver endorsements for transporting dangerous or hazardous materials.",

                "content": "Reply 2 (my comment was too long)\n\nAir Transport (Private Carrier by Air)\n\nTransporting goods by air, whether domestically or internationally, involves significant security and regulatory oversight due to airspace control, customs regulations, and security requirements. Private air cargo operations (i.e., transporting your own goods via air) have specific requirements that differ from those of Indirect Air Carriers (IAC) that transport goods on behalf of others.\n\nCommon Requirements by Country/Region:\n\nAir Operator Certificates (AOC): In most countries, to operate an aircraft commercially (even as a private carrier), you need an Air Operator Certificate issued by the national aviation authority (e.g., FAA in the U.S., EASA in Europe, DGCA in India, or CAAC in China). This certificate ensures that the aircraft is airworthy, and all operational procedures meet international safety standards.\n\nIndirect Air Carrier (IAC) Registration:\n\nU.S./North America: In the U.S., an IAC license is required for entities arranging for goods to be transported via commercial aircraft on behalf of others. However, if you are shipping your own goods (e.g., an Etsy seller), you do not need this license as long as you're using third-party carriers like FedEx or DHL. The same logic applies globally\u2014third-party air freight companies handle security regulations, not the sender.\n\nEurope/Worldwide: In the EU and UK, companies such as DHL or UPS act as Regulated Agents under European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Security Regulations, so businesses sending their own goods through these agents do not require additional air transport licenses.\n\nCustoms and Security Clearances: Most countries, including those in the EU, Asia, and Africa, require detailed customs documentation for international air shipments. International aviation security measures, like those enforced by TSA in the U.S. and Transport Canada in Canada, demand compliance with screening requirements, but these are typically managed by the air carrier or freight forwarder.\n\nAirworthiness and Piloting: If you own and operate your own aircraft for shipping, your aircraft must meet the airworthiness standards of your national aviation authority (FAA, EASA, etc.), and pilots must have the proper commercial or private pilot\u2019s license.",

                "content": "Reply 3 (comment is too long)\n\nSea Transport (Private Carrier by Sea)\n\nShipping goods by sea involves additional layers of regulation depending on the waters and ports you operate in. Private shipping can range from operating small boats to larger vessels, and the regulations differ accordingly.\n\nCommon Requirements by Country/Region:\n\nMaritime Licensing (Worldwide): Operating a sea vessel, especially for commercial purposes, will require vessel registration and certification through national maritime authorities (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard in the U.S., Marine Maritime Organization (IMO) globally, European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) in Europe, and local authorities in other countries).\n\nFla State Requirements: The flag your ship sails under will often determine the regulations you need to comply with. For instance, countries like Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands are known for their open registries where ship owners can register vessels under a foreign flag, which may have different rules and requirements than the country where the business operates.\n\nCustoms and Border Procedures: If you are transporting goods internationally, you will need to comply with customs regulations of both the exporting and importing country. These typically include filing for customs declarations, securing import/export permits, and following port security protocols. This is true for major ports in Asia (e.g., China, India, Singapore), Europe (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, UK), and Africa (e.g., South Africa, Kenya).\n\nDangerous Goods: Maritime transport of dangerous goods is regulated by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which most countries adopt. If you are shipping hazardous materials, you will need to follow these rules.\n\n\n\nAdditional Considerations Across Modes:\n\nInternational Trade Compliance: If you're shipping goods across borders, you'll need to comply with each country\u2019s import/export laws, which may include obtaining an Importer of Record status or export licenses (e.g., through CBP in the U.S. or HMRC in the UK).\n\nInsurance Requirements: Different countries may mandate cargo insurance depending on the value of goods and type of transport. For example, in Brazil, mandatory cargo insurance is required for all goods transported by road.\n\nInternational Conventions: Many countries adhere to international conventions that harmonize transport regulations, such as the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), Montreal Convention for air freight, and The Hague-Visby Rules for sea freight.",

I understand many factors influence this, but I\u2019m mainly interested in food distribution. (2) How do mileage rates compare to IRS mileage reimbursement rates? Specifically, if your mileage earnings are lower than the reimbursement you can receive, can you use that reimbursement to reduce other income? For example, if I\u2019m a delivery driver paid only for the distance from Point A to B, but my reimbursement covers the trip to A, A-B, and back to A, can I apply that reimbursement to lower my taxable income elsewhere, like taxes on the goods I\u2019m delivering?

For smaller companies they can\u2019t be as flexible but the warning signs have been there",

Using an alternate is a bit more expensive, not necessarily slower and you get a more personalized service (thus less errors).\n\nIn the USA, you can have an alternate custom broker clear the import, but it'll take a couple of extra days and there's no cost saving.

I have no experience with shipping from China to the US and I'm unsure whom to consult or what questions to ask. I don't require a large volume since my products don't include batteries or hazardous materials\u2014about 1-2 containers annually should suffice. It\u2019s been a steep learning curve, and this is more of a side project than my main income. I initially planned to have shipments sent to my home and manage domestic shipping myself, as I can work flexible hours from home. So far, I\u2019ve only used regular (and costly) shipping for testing. In the future, I might consider hiring a distribution company, so any advice on that would be appreciated.",

Once the container has arrived into the port, it'll be discharged from the vessel after a few working days, the company you have contracted to move your goods will then take the container to a \"devan\" shed which is a freight term for unloading containers. They'll unpack all the goods, and palletise them as per each customer. They'll let you know when it's unpacked and cleared customs, and you can arrange for the goods to be delivered to your final destination (your door) from there.\n\n  \nThings to look out for:\n\nEnsuring the goods you've purchased are sent via DDP (Delivered duty paid) so there are no further charges once they reach the US, unless you've already worked out the incoterms. DDU is duty unpaid, and you'd be liable to pay duty charges to customs (not sure the rates for US) for the goods to be released. Just be careful that you understand the incoterms before purchasing goods & shipping them. \n\n  \nSince you'll be booking via LCL, there is a bunch of other goods for other people within the container.. Not sure if it's the same for US, but in the UK, we have bonded warehouses also known as ETSF's, whereby the container can be taken off quay to a devan shed before all the goods have cleared. This is what you want, as if you're stuck in a smaller freight forwarders container and someone elses goods are chosen for customs checks etc, your freight will be stuck with it until all other goods have cleared.\n\n  \nInsurance... It's \"included\" within the freight charge, but usually only covers you based on weight rather than value... If your goods are high-value then look to have them insured properly.",

I work about 60 hours a week and commute three hours daily since my company won't allow remote work. Recently, they started micromanaging me, despite my strong performance. My approach has been to make cold calls and nurture leads, often stepping in to handle operational tasks due to understaffing. However, my sales management insists I should only focus on sales.

A lot of extra steps for most-likely minimal cost savings, and when you factor in the extra time you spend doing this, you may be losing money compared to if you had spent that time taking care of other tasks.",

However, this morning I received an email stating that the courier reported a 1.90 kg weight discrepancy from what we initially provided, resulting in an additional charge of 54.72 EUR. Are they legally allowed to charge us after delivery? Shouldn\u2019t they have informed us of this discrepancy before shipping, so we could consider other options? Since this wasn\u2019t communicated beforehand, I don\u2019t see how we can agree to pay this fee. I\u2019m searching online for information but can\u2019t find any.

I'm confused about why there are two addresses. Is the second one meant for US residents and domestic shipping?",

While it functions adequately, its accuracy is limited to about 0.2 oz. Additionally, I own a 5lb USB scale that I no longer use, as I stopped using it some time ago. I'm looking for a recommended integrated shipping scale for letters and small packages (up to 30 lbs) that offers better accuracy (0.1 oz or finer) and can directly connect with various shipping platforms. By \"directly connects,\" I mean it should either communicate with the shipping platform so that when I weigh an item, the correct amount automatically appears on the shipping platform, or it should allow for easy input with a button press. For instance, a USB scale could emulate a keyboard, entering values like \"2.15\" for 2.15 lbs or \"8\" for 7.9 oz. The scale should be automatic but will require software, and since I use online shipping platforms, it likely needs to emulate a keyboard.",

If any item exceeds $100, the whole package may incur duties. I declared the total as 3 plush toys for $250, 10 keychains for $50, 20 stickers for $50, and 20 art prints for $30, totaling over $300. I used the total cost instead of listing individual item values. Am I in trouble? I really don\u2019t want him to have to pay anything; that would be awkward!",

When my package arrived a month late, I found that half of the boxes were damaged, but I couldn't see this until I was in the warehouse since they were in a larger box. The subcontractor replied, stating that the transportation company noted the consignee signed off on the Bill of Lading without reporting any issues at delivery, so they can't be held responsible since I reported the damage a day later. I have boxes ready to go and just want them to cover the shipping costs from Mexico for the damaged products. I'm not asking for a refund on my bill. What should I do next?",

I'm moving internationally, and my current shipping company for personal belongings (LCL) isn't certified for dangerous goods. I need to transport a small personal supply of hobby-grade spray paint (about 30 cans), classified as Class 2.1, UN1950, with a total weight of around 6kg and dimensions of approximately 30x30x15cm. Ideally, I want a door-to-door service. I have a preliminary quote from FedEx for shipping, but I'm unsure about the necessary paperwork (export certification, special packaging requirements, etc.), and FedEx requires an invoice even for personal items. I know this will likely be costly, possibly as much as buying new paint, but shipping is more convenient if I can handle the paperwork. Thanks!",

I ordered a package from Spain to the Netherlands (tracking number: 12341625923), which was shipped on October 16th. Initially, everything went smoothly; the package was handed to GLS, processed, and reached the distribution center in Germany by October 18th. However, since then, it has been \u201cin transit\u201d with no updates. I've attempted to contact GLS via their website and email, but I've received no replies. As of October 28th, I still don't know the whereabouts of my package or when it will arrive in the Netherlands. Has anyone else faced similar delays with GLS for international shipments? Any suggestions on what to do next would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

Each Christmas, we spend days at the table putting papers in envelopes, adding stamps and labels. I thought a gift could be an e.g. printer that prints labels and stamps directly on the envelopes. However, I\u2019m struggling to find one that works and costs under a thousand dollars. I don't need it to fold, stuff, or lick envelopes, but I need a combination of 1. a service for printable stamps, compatible with 2. software that can import our address list (I can write a script to convert a CSV if necessary), and 3. a printer that can handle 20 or more greeting card envelopes and print labels with about 95% accuracy. I've done some research and found some options, but I'm worried about compatibility issues, like whether the service exports in a usable format, requires individual printing, or if the printer only accepts one envelope at a time. Does anyone know of a compatible set or any individual components that might work?",

Some sites show \u201cItem bagged\u201d (India Post) or \u201cDeparted from export office\u201d (EMS) on the 16th, while others like 17track and Global Parcel show my package moving back and forth between Mumbai and Frankfurt, which is strange. Today, I checked the tracking, and those flight records are missing from all but one site. I'm worried because it's been two weeks without any updates. Does this mean my package is stuck in customs, just waiting to be scanned by USPS, or could it be lost? Has anyone experienced similar issues with international shipping from India? I heard USPS doesn't prioritize packages from India. How long did it take for your packages to arrive? The items I ordered are important, so any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

According to their policy, Premium members get 30 days of free storage, while Basic members receive 5 days. However, in practice, if a package sits for 5 days, they still charge storage fees afterwards, even for parcels that have been there less than 5 days. For instance, I was charged for a package that was logged just one day before billing. They also deducted money from my PayPal account without notice. I had delays due to incorrect logging of contents and a package that was never logged, which is now considered lost. This situation forces me to incur additional shipping costs. \n\nThe company's practices seem designed to maximize profit from free members by ensuring they exceed the 5-day limit, resulting in storage fees. They also delay package registration, leading to additional fees. Overall, I anticipate spending an extra $75 due to these issues, including unauthorized storage charges and increased shipping fees. Even premium members face similar problems, as I experienced last year when packages took 30-45 days to log, leading to significant extra costs. I had hoped to give them another chance, but I won't be using their services again.",

I wasn't aware that their orders were handled by Piggyship until now. My order has been out for delivery for two days without any updates. I compared the shipping updates with previous orders, which were similar, suggesting Piggyship has delivered for me before. However, during the last delay, I received an update. I'm worried I won't receive this order on time, especially after reading some concerning threads about Piggyship/Piggy Express. Any advice would be appreciated.",

However, even if you (if you are the sender), mark it as a gift, you still have to declare the full fair market value of all of the goods in the shipment. Parcels marked as gifts with no declaration or a declaration of no value are the ones that get flagged for inspection.",

        "content": "Hello! I'm looking for advice after three years in my current field. A bit about me: I'm in my early 30s, from the US, with a background in visual arts and event production. I transitioned to inventory work due to retail experience and now find myself in logistics/supply chain coordinator roles, which involve order processing, customer communication, basic freight booking, incident processing, and collaborating with accounting and procurement to resolve inventory issues, primarily in the food CPG sector. I'm unhappy in my current position, not due to the nature of the work, but because of my environment. I see this career as a stable income to help achieve my goals. I have several questions: \n\n1. How can I transition to a more appealing industry? I'm interested in toys, games, and music but get quickly rejected when applying outside food.\n2. Is there a way to work internationally? I don't speak other languages but am willing to learn. I'm particularly interested in East Asia but am open to other regions. I assume import/export could be a pathway, but I'm unsure how to acquire that skill.\n3. If relocating abroad isn't an option, is there fully remote work available? How can I find it?\n4. What are the best job boards for these roles?\n5. What's a cost-effective, short way to enhance my skills? I feel my skills are fragmented due to my unconventional background and I often feel outmatched by supply chain MBAs. I'm not a data expert, but I\u2019m practical and can improve with some guidance. Thank you!",

I'm interested in process optimization, data analytics, and problem-solving. I also speak three languages relevant to my country's supply chain and want to use them effectively at work.

My job covered the cost of an online course and the exam (including a retake), and I successfully passed on my first attempt with a score of 319 earlier this week. I don't have a background in supply chain or manufacturing, and prior to the course a year ago, I had no knowledge of the subject. I've been a production and supply planner for 18 months.\n\nRegarding studying: Everyone has their own learning style. For me, the classroom experience wasn\u2019t very beneficial; the material was dry, and the effectiveness seemed to depend on the instructor's quality. I realized early on that I would need to depend on the textbooks and online resources. Although I completed the instructor-led course out of respect for my employer, I believe I would have been better off just reading the books. I spent eight weeks re-reading all three books before the exam, taking online tests, and focusing on my weakest areas. A crucial part of my prep was reviewing the exam content manual a few days before the test and noting down concepts I struggled with. I used ChatGPT to get brief definitions and summaries for those concepts, which helped me pick up many easy points on the exam that I might have otherwise missed.\n\nThe week before the exam, I scored between 60-80% on practice tests. I felt unprepared and even tried to reschedule the exam two nights before, but couldn't. Fortunately, that worked out for me. \n\nFor the exam itself, I took it in person and arrived early, which they accommodated. I used the provided noise-canceling headphones, which were helpful. You have 3.5 hours, and I finished in 1.5 hours. The questions include straightforward ones, but many are frustratingly worded, leading to educated guesses on about a third to half of the exam. My strategy was to narrow down to the top two options and trust my instincts, which felt unsettling but ultimately led to success. The exam's language and style differed significantly from the course materials, making it feel like it was created by a different group.\n\nAfter the exam, you complete a five-minute survey, which can be frustrating while waiting for results. I received my scores immediately, ranging from 67% to 95% across different topics, but individual experiences may vary based on exam difficulty. Familiarity with common formulas is helpful, as the questions often provide a",

Below is just an example of the thought exercise. \n\nSupply Chain Operations: finished school, and looked around the job market for a slightly above entry level position. School allows for a leg up against non degree applicants, and your experience in a factory shows hands on knowledge of physical things. You will have chosen between x y and z companies, and possibly a b and c industries. You\u2019ve done your research and let\u2019s say decided to take an analyst position at Trillium Health Partners. You\u2019re making $75k per year (avg salary in Ontario for an analyst at Trillium). Your career path is likely a slow one, but steady. THP is booming and has a bright future. AI has taken its niche and will continue to grow, but you\u2019ve protected against that by choosing a job that is complex enough to not be directly replaced by AI. In 10 years, if you want to manage people, you\u2019re a Sr Manager and are making $125k with bonus. \n\nAccounting: you\u2019ve finished your degree and have a wide variety of choices of industries and companies. You knew that AI would have a very large impact on this sector, so you\u2019ve decided to take a position as a cost analyst, which combines complex operational planning as well as accounting knowledge. You\u2019re working on mitigating costs for Loblaw\u2019s supply chain group. You\u2019ll find it harder to stay with one company, since these accounting roles are very competitive and some of the first to be outsourced or downsized, so you\u2019ll need to change roles every few years to go up the ladder. In 10 years, you\u2019re a Senior Finance Manager at Nestl\u00e9 and making $165k with bonus. \n\nThese are just examples of course, but I\u2019d encourage you to write this out and do the research as if it were 5 years from now, Halloween 2029. Once you finish, what does your life outside of work look like? What do you like to do? Do you have a family? \n\nThen sit with this vision of the future for a few days and rewrite it as you think of different things or find new things in your research. Maybe you have two visions and you are choosing which is best. \n\nAfter all that, your gut/heart will guide you on what\u2019s best. Trust in your truth about what you want your life to be, and pick a career that enables you to do those things. Don\u2019t pick your career to fulfill you in life, pick a career that gives you the opportunity to be fulfilled in the rest of your life beyond work.",

I've received positive feedback for my performance, especially considering my limited experience, and I enjoy my job. However, I often find myself unfairly blamed for issues beyond my control from both suppliers and customers. Recently, we lost a new supplier account due to delayed pickups, despite my repeated requests to prioritize these loads. The sales representative in charge of this account has been passive-aggressive towards me, and while I followed the correct procedures, the situation reflects poorly on me.

I got a job in purchasing back in January of this year, 2024, and I honestly kind of regret it. It does have its perks compared to my old job. I used to work in a retail store where my main job was dealing with inventory. I still had to run the \u201csales floor\u201d, so I still dealt with people, both employees and customers, but thankfully I did spend a lot of my time in the back working on inventory (inbound and outbound) and this most certainly gave me a GREAT understanding of the most basic fundamentals. Coming back to my current job, I honestly don\u2019t like it. Purchasing is doing the same exact thing every single day and then finding lost shipments that are, of course, always the most expensive ones. I wish I had chosen a different industry, but that\u2019s a me thing. That being said, I\u2019ve been trying to spend as much time as I can, without neglecting my duties, out in the warehouse, lending a hand, watching, and even just hanging out with the warehouse folks. Because I understand that 1. They handle my sh*t, it pays to be nice to them. And 2. They\u2019re human and deserve more than my snarky emails about why my stock for this item hasn\u2019t been scanned in yet. This ended up being much more long-winded than I intended, but I hope it helps you get my point and best of luck to you.",

I have around 6 years of experience in the restaurant industry, including 1.5 years managing inventories and orders for multiple locations, implementing new inventory software, and training staff during a transition. Currently, I work as a bartender in a large hotel with great benefits that aren't available in restaurants, but I want to avoid a lifetime of weekend night shifts. The restaurant environment isn't ideal for my happiness either. A purchasing manager position has opened up, which aligns with some of my experience, though it involves mainly food ordering, something I'm not familiar with. The previous hire left shortly after starting, which raises concerns since he came from another hotel. However, my manager, who previously held this role, assured me I could learn it despite my lack of direct experience. What are your thoughts on the long-term prospects of this position? I don\u2019t want to be stuck in an entry-level management role forever, especially since upward movement is limited due to the department\u2019s ties to accounting. I see potential for growth into hotel operations management as I develop my financial skills. Additionally, would experience in hotel purchasing be applicable to other industries? I don\u2019t have a degree, but I\u2019m open to pursuing relevant certifications, although I may struggle with a degree due to past challenges in school. Thanks for your advice!",

If you are looking for stability, you have a process problem. Look at S&OP, S&OE, innovation stage gating, and any network planning reviews that you can standardize.

After renegotiating, the cost of each order is now 1k. Should you report this as 1k in savings, or calculate it over time to show 2k savings by the second order and 4k for the whole year? My colleagues believe it should be reported as 1k, but I wonder why it couldn't be presented as a compounded 4k savings for the year. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks.",

        "content": "The U.S. warehouse market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. After an unprecedented surge fueled by e-commerce during the pandemic, the market is now facing a slowdown characterized by increasing vacancy rates. This raises the question: is this a temporary setback or a long-term change? In 2020, with e-commerce sales jumping over 30%, warehouse space was in high demand, leading major companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Target to expand their fulfillment networks, resulting in a national vacancy rate as low as 3.4%. However, vacancy rates have now climbed to 6.4%, the highest since 2014. Several factors contribute to this shift: 1. Overbuilding and Reduced Demand: Companies added substantial warehouse space during the pandemic, but much of it now sits empty as demand has stabilized. 2. Impact of Rising Interest Rates: Increased interest rates are making it difficult for developers to pursue new warehouse projects, causing a notable decline in speculative construction. 3. Changes in E-commerce Patterns: While online sales continue to rise, the growth rate has slowed down to a more moderate level.",

It would be like watching a TV channel that is mostly just commercials. Commercials that are overwhelmingly products that are not anything you would ever have anything to do with. \n\nTry instead looking for groups that revolve around your specific niche. Don't advertise your product though, instead, add value to the conversations. Might try to tastefully try to use your product in examples of how you address someone's question. Otherwise if you try to sell something, most groups worth being in will ban you.\n\n Also, keep your eye out for anyone asking about your type of product and DM them directly.",

Practice tonight using your computer's online calculator and basic whiteboard features because that's all you get. Practice especially a BOM tree explosion. It's easy to do on paper and you sketch it out. But weird when you have to do it on the stupid whiteboard. Same with exponential smoothing. Although it's just 3 or 4 lines so it's not that bad.  \n  \nMost of the math is pretty straight forward, so don't worry too much about it. Know the EOQ formula. Make sure you know how to do a long version of TAKT time. And know that stupid accounting formula for payables + days outstanding. They try to get tricky with the terminology so be ready for that. Maybe run a few scenarios thru ChatGPT.  \n  \nSo, STAY POSITIVE THRU THE ENTIRE TEST! That's my big tip. You'll hit a patch of rough questions and you'll start getting frustrated. Don't! Stay calm and keep going. I almost ruined my test because I was getting angry. LOL.  \n  \nDon't flag too many questions. You'll be tired at the end and won't want to deal with them at the end.  \n  \nAnd...have a bathroom plan man! Seriously. The test is 3.5 hours and there is no break (Stupid I know). I almost just went on the floor. lol. After about 2.5 hours it got brutal. So don't drink too much or wear your APICS approved adult diaper. I couldn't review my flagged questions.

I currently speak English and my native language, but I'm considering learning an additional language to enhance my job prospects. Should I learn Chinese, French, Spanish, or Dutch? Since many Dutch people are proficient in English, I would prefer to focus on other languages. Thank you for your advice!",

Learn it in Taiwan for a few semesters and then go to China if that's were you will ultimately go for work. But, there is still a lot of manufacturing done in Taiwan and the economy still keeps growing despite the various challenges. \n\nThe Taiwanese government offers scholarships to come to Taiwan to study Chinese. It pays your tuition and a bit for basic living expenses. A semester of a Chinese immersion course of 15 hours a week it roughly $1200 USD (without living expenses). Every major city in Taiwan has a few different universities that offer these programs. If you don't qualify for the scholarships you can just pay the tuition yourself. The whole process is pretty simple. \\[[Link](https://www.studyintaiwan.org/chinese)\\]",

Eventually, I was reassigned to the export department due to staff shortages. It turned out to be a stressful, operational role, and I struggled with the office politics and workload. As my internship neared its end, I was offered an extension with promises of moving to the desired department, but three months later, I\u2019m still stuck in exports with no clear path to change. I'm dissatisfied and feel like the environment is toxic. I see my peers in more fulfilling roles with better work-life balance, while I\u2019m overwhelmed with monotonous tasks that don\u2019t utilize my skills. I\u2019m considering staying a few more months until I might burn out, then pursuing a master\u2019s degree, but I still want to work in the interim. Any advice would be appreciated!",

Alternatively, can we use DAP and only address customs duties? Thanks!",

I averaged about 70% on Learning Center and Pocket Prep quizzes, and 74% on the final practice test. While these resources are helpful, the actual exam is more straightforward and focuses on identifying the \"more\" correct answer. My main advice is to read the material thoroughly 1-3 times. I used the Speechify app to listen to the books while driving or walking, which was beneficial. It's vital to understand how the concepts connect. The quizzes and practice tests are good for checking comprehension, but I only saw 4-5 similar questions on the exam. For the math section, be sure to know basic formulas, how to explode a BOM, moving averages, exponential smoothing, and capacity (both demonstrated and efficiency). Good luck to all studying!

However, it feels like a mistake to relocate me so far, especially since there are 17 similar locations in my current region with frequent openings. I can\u2019t help but think I might quit within a year or two. While I\u2019ll gain valuable experience and have a good salary, being so far from loved ones isn\u2019t what I envisioned for starting my career.

My (now) wife was excited about the location, I was excited, we spent a weekend figuring out where we'd want to look for housing. \n\nDuring training, everytime I mentioned the location, people gave me weird looks, saying \"huh interesting...\" or, \"wonder what that's about\".\n\nI finally spoke up to our program manager and asked what the deal was. They got the cart before the horse and offered me a location they were hoping to have via acquisition, but it fell through. So they reassigned me, to an extremely remote corner of the country (we were 4 hours from a commercial airport!).\n\nMind you, I already signed a 2 year commitment with significant penalties if I walked away. I called my then girlfriend and gave her an out - I was stuck but she could bail if she needed to. She fortunately did not, and moved with me and we were there for 4 years. \n\nThat was the *best* decision either of us ever made. We made lifelong friends, we figured out how to be an adult with our families more than 18 hours away, and I made connections professionally that have absolutely paved the path I'm on now.\n\nI get your apprehension and frustration - been there to an extent. Look at it as an opportunity. Kinda sounds like this might be your first time moving away from home - embrace it! Sometimes, moving far away from family is the best thing for you to grow as a human and professionally. It's OK to be pissed or homesick - but now is your chance at a young age to figure out who *you* are without the noise of family nearby.",

If it's the company I suspect it is, continually moving you all over the country with little care about your preferences is part of the culture and you are better off leaving if you would rather have stability in your life. \n\nIf you do decide to bite the bullet and take the relo, make sure you are crystal clear on the terms of it. Most companies have a claw-back period of 12-18 months for relo costs if you leave or are fired for cause.  I've seen people get royally screwed in relos they weren't happy with because it affected their performance which put them at the top of the list at layoff time. It sucks getting fired, but it REALLY sucks getting fired in a strange place 9 hours from home with no family, no contacts, and no stipend to get back to where you want to be. \n\nSince you are already considering leaving if you are forced to relo, have a frank talk with your manager or HR about what's going on. They may tell you to pound sand, but they may also decide it's not worth the pain in the rump to replace you so they will give some credence to your preference.

Sometimes growers and producers make questionable choices to just stay afloat. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that \u2018child\u2019 labor is traditionally utilized on farms. You have kids, and they help out around the farm as soon as they\u2019re able. One of these reasons traditional farms are dying is because there\u2019s a better life to be had, so kids don\u2019t get into farming. My dad had 3 kids, none of us do anything remotely farm related.

                "content": "Natural is a labeling definition.  Consumers associate the term natural with lots of other ideas...if it's better for me, it must be better for the planet and it's people right?  Many brands do have an ethos of responsibility and sustainability, and those are also more likely to have a cleaner label and  promote being natural. \n\nThe term natural doesn't directly correlate with how that product or company impacts the planet or society.  There can be artificial products that are very sustainable and ethical. And some natural products that aren't.\n\nTwo things to consider: Natural and artificial products are both derived from a plant or animal source.  And both are made at a very very large scale. High volumes and economies of scale are required to grow big enough to reach the grocery store.  Even a 'small' brand is leveraging global sourcing and large scale production, either as part of a larger company or through a co-man.   And at that level, that means lots of suppliers and a fairly sizeable carbon footprint. (There are billions of mouths to feed!)\n\nOne thing I can assure you, both the ethical, regulatory, quality, financial, and environmental impact are routinely discussed at all levels of the industry.  Brands both big and small are having these discussions every time they roll out a new product or even a change in ingredient.  And suppliers are scrutinized quite closely to ensure compliance. (You're ultimately responsible for everything you put in your product. You wouldn't be in business long if you didn't do your due diligence).  \n\nThe difference would be how much weight is assigned to one of these factors. They are all part of the calculus. Some companies certainly make decisions that are not the best option financially, if it fits with their brand or values. No matter how much passion you have for the planet, any successful company still has to find a balance between that and the other factors like cost, quality, etc. \n\nAsk yourself what the perfect product would be from an environmental or ethical perspective.  Assume you could source everything locally and ethically, offset the carbon required to produce the energy to cook it, pack it in paper made from renewable plants, and deliver it on bicycles or sailboats. The most passionate consumers might appreciate your level of effort. And the wealthiest of those consumers might even be able to afford it. But the vast majority of your target market cannot afford a $35 loaf of perfectly sustainable bread. \n\nSo like any industry, food companies can and do take steps to limit the impact, while also ensuring they are affordable to consumers and profitable as a company.  As with anything this big, there is still massive room for improvement. Plenty of waste and inefficiency exists. \n\nTo be truly \"natural\" and still feed billions of people is going to require more than just industry.  Especially in developed countries where consumers demand cheap, fast, and readily available food in great abundance. It's hard enough getting shoppers to give up their plastic grocery bags. \n\nBut it is absolutely being talked about. It's not just a buzzword and it's not limited just to natural products.  At least I hope it is because I just spent 12 hours in sustainable procurement training last month! \n.",

My role involves order management and logistics, including managing supplier relationships, tracking deliveries, and organizing inbound shipments. I plan to enhance my Excel skills, particularly with Power Query, in the future. Previously, I worked for 14 months as a Sourcing & Costing Assistant at an outdoor shoe company, collaborating with Asian suppliers on product development and collections. I enjoyed negotiating costs, exploring new materials, sourcing suppliers, and attending trade fairs, while my boss frequently traveled to Asia. I began my career as an intern but left to focus on my studies and explore other opportunities. Although my current job is building my technical logistics and supply chain skills, I miss the R&D involvement, travel opportunities, and hands-on experience from my previous role. I'm curious if there are positions that integrate supply chain and R&D, allowing me to leverage my logistics skills and background. I hold a bachelor's in Economics and I'm in my final year of an International Management MSc. Thank you for your advice!",

As application deadlines approach, I've been researching universities and relevant bachelor\u2019s degrees but haven't found much information. I\u2019m curious about the degrees that others in this subreddit hold and how they have helped in their current jobs. I've noticed some recommend a BBA with a focus on supply chain management, while others offer a specific bachelor\u2019s in supply chain management. However, many job listings in Canada also accept degrees in engineering, business, supply chain management, analytics, or construction management. I'm feeling overwhelmed by the variety of options and would appreciate any advice or insights!",

I recognize that businesses may have occasional service misses, so I limit RCCA requests to these instances. For context, the carrier is above the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the monthly reporting period. Do you prefer my approach or my boss's?

I\u2019m posting to see if anyone has a non-proprietary product or component I could use for these videos.

Of course, nothing sensitive\u2014perhaps just a sub-component. I realize this is a long shot, but it\u2019s for a good cause, as many inventors get scammed at this stage.

Logistics is a very board description, what exactly are you doing? I\u2019m sure you could relate some of what you do to procurement, but don\u2019t lie and change the title. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just an internship. It\u2019s not going to get you stuck in a particular field. My internship was store operations for retail company, and my first job out of college was rotational program in aerospace. Companies just want to see you put the work in and got something done. There are going to be people applying for jobs that have no internship at all, so don\u2019t stress about it. Outside of your internship you can do some volunteer or business frat work in college to beef up your resume. Like it\u2019s been said, don\u2019t stress it too much. You\u2019re in college still, nothing you do right now is defining your career, it\u2019s just starting! Let me know if you have any questions",

Talk to someone in procurement, learn their day to day, and ask questions , you could potentially get asked at an interview. \n\nOn your resume, change the title of your position to procurement intern or along the line of that. And add some responsibilities related to procurement that you can speak too. Just gotta make it believable. \n\nI personally would advise you to get into management of some sort, way , way more money. \n\nI\u2019ll probably get downvotes or someone is going to act like the description mentioned above. But switching/pivoting all depends on your responsibilities and job title on your resume. And background checks ONLY CHECK if you worked at a conpany or not. They don\u2019t care about your title, nor your manager, just if you worked there.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re white, with majority of the people in you department sectors being white, just socialize and you\u2019ll be able to pivot just as easily",

Reviewing samples for overall quality to see if they match the specs. Entering in the details of the product into some kind of product master or purchase order. Things like that could be automated. \n\nRegarding assistant buyers being made obsolete, fashion executives aren\u2019t stupid, and they\u2019re not going to diminish their bench strength for short term gains (well the smart companies won\u2019t). If they automated away assistant buyer roles, and people coming out of FIT or wherever had no place to go, these companies would be killing themselves slowly by not developing a bench for when their existing buyers attrition. They may reduce headcount overall, but they\u2019re not going to just do away with it. \n\nCertain other functions like parsing out under performers, analyzing seasonal trends and the like could also be automated. \n\nBut I think the core of fashion buying is relationships and a human intuition on trends and styles. As creative as \u201cAI\u201d can be, there\u2019s an undeniable human element to market makers and following the market maker trends. Haute couture designers set the trends a year or two out, and then depending on where your brand fits into the life cycle of a garment trends, you\u2019re either riding the wave immediately or tracking how the trends roll downstream over time into mass apparel markets. All of this is a very human and relationship driven business. I don\u2019t see any AI, even on the horizon that would be capable of replacing this. It could help analyze it and speed up the life cycle, but not replace. \n\nCould a brand choose to go full AI and just have some Midjourney type system create trends for them? Definitely, and that\u2019ll probably happen. It\u2019ll have niche popularity, but not big enough to upset the industry. \n\nTl;dr certain mechanical functions of the buying process will definitely be automated, and assistant buyer jobs could diminish, but the core of fashion buying probably won\u2019t. \n\nSource: Director of Supply Chain in fashion",

        "content": "I'm looking for someone to create a specific style of box for my new product. It needs to feature drop-down flaps on the top and bottom to provide two different 'backdrops' (the images below illustrate what I mean). Ideally, the box should be luxury, recyclable, and have a matte finish (I can finalize the specifications with the designer). Can anyone suggest the name for this box style? My attempts to describe it as having extra flaps have not been successful. Additionally, I would appreciate recommendations for UK-based packaging suppliers who can assist. I understand there may be tooling costs, and I'm planning an initial run of 500 to 1,000 boxes to test the market, so I expect costs to be higher than bulk orders. However, I'm struggling to get responses to my inquiries. Thank you in advance!",

I have some limited experience with folding cartons and reboard, but I'm not as familiar with them as I am with corrugated. I lack experience in customer or supplier interactions and have not worked in large-scale manufacturing or with materials beyond paper.

I've successfully created my first scalable standard for my team, which is great! Now, I'm starting on a second standard that overlaps significantly with the first, but has a different bottom structure. To avoid redrawing 80% of the first design, I want to save it under a new name and modify it. I've deleted the old bottom, but when I tried to remove the related variables, ArtiosCAD wouldn't allow it. It seems the variables are still referenced in the file's history (Help > Diagnostics > Edit log), even though I've deleted that part of the drawing. What\u2019s the correct way to remove the old design elements and their variables to clear space for the new ones without creating confusion?",

Initially, we relied on Weissorbent, believing they were the best for keeping items dry. However, after a few months, I noticed a decline in the quality of their RH and O2 absorbers. When I raised my concerns, they only provided their specifications and refused to investigate. After some research, I discovered SorbentSystems (also known as IMPAK). A sales representative engaged with me about my order and suggested testing their absorbers against Weissorbent's. They shared quality assurance data, which revealed that Weissorbent's desiccants were significantly less effective than claimed. Since then, I've been very satisfied with SorbentSystems; their team is responsive, and their products meet my needs perfectly. In short, if you're in the packaging industry, consider trying IMPAK. We've made the switch, and our dried goods are thriving.",

I\u2019m proficient in Solidworks and have extensive experience in packaging design for manufacturing. While my current role focuses on folding cartons and corrugated materials, I also have experience with tins and vacuum-formed packaging. I aim to leverage more of my skills and influence overall design, aspiring to work on complete package structures. For instance, a recent pair of earbuds I bought featured a folding carton, a complex paperboard insert, a vacuum-formed insert, and a structured envelope for the manual. I want a role that heavily involves design and engineering decisions. However, I\u2019ve learned from a packaging engineer at a major consumer goods company that their job mainly focuses on sourcing, ERP, and project management, with little design involvement. Many design positions I see concentrate more on branding and graphics, while structural design roles in the US often lean towards consumer packaged goods and food packaging, which I find less appealing. I prefer to design packaging for durable products like toys or electronics. What job titles and companies should I target? Do I need further education, or can I transition with my current experience? \n\nUpdate: I recently secured a new position as a structural designer on the supplier side, where the company handles various packaging types, including primary packaging like bottles and jars. Although it\u2019s not my ideal job, I am utilizing more of my skillset, and I\u2019m satisfied with my decision after a few months and plan to stay for a few years.",

Most CPG companies divide out their packaging groups by front end and back end. This means that front usually works with marketing to execute designs (sourcing, technical development with sourcing partners, some testing, approvals, artwork, and so on). Back end is all the other stuff once the development is over (manufacturing,  filling, testing, tertiary pack dev etc etc). It is VERY rare for an individual to have influence or design power at a CPG on the packaging. In my past life I was involved in some of these but I had very little say, it was mostly just in meetings with stakeholders (creatives and designers) and decision makers (marketers and executives). Currently I'm super lucky as my company is a bit different and I manage the external design agency. This is where I brief and review all new designs and forms and then once they're approved execute. It's fun. \n\nFrom your post above it sounds like you need to be at a Packaging Design Firm or a Creative Firm of some kind that deals with many different brands. This will fulfill your needs and use your skill sets. \n\nPackaging developers at CPG barely get to influence the design it is more about execution. And if you're at a supplier you will be focused on whatever they make, specifically, paper, plastics etc. \n\nHope this helps.",

I've tried various keywords in Europe, where I live, but haven't found anything similar. Does anyone know the name of these boxes or where I can purchase them? Thanks!",

While there are many suppliers that can create basic cardboard boxes, their quality tends to be subpar, as the cardboard deteriorates easily even when thicker materials are specified. I've been observing packaging for other products and found a box for a Synology that perfectly matches what I need (see images below). \n\nI'm curious if there are specific terms or materials I should look for to ensure better quality cardboard. Additionally, I would appreciate recommendations for reliable suppliers to help me achieve this. Thank you in advance! \n\nHere are some examples of poor quality from our current supplier:",

                "content": "I'll try to help you. Please understand that there are nuances in every individual case that I cannot account for, so my word is not truth for every situation. If you have more questions after or if something doesn't make sense I can try to expand further, but I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible.\n\n1st. Difference between your box and Synology box - The box style is different. Yours is a 2 side rollover tray (FEFCO 0427), very similar to a pizza box style. The synology box looks to be something like a swing-in rollover style box with a locking tab (FEFCO 0470). These styles in my experience will result in very different finishes, as demonstrated by your pictures. \n\n2nd. Assuming these trays are made using the same flute (looks to be B flute perhaps), It is very possible that these boxes are run on different style machines. While both are unglued diecuts, there are two main style diecutters in our industry: Rotary and Flatbed. Rotary being cheaper (usually, but that might be mainly due to the throughput), higher volume, and usually lower quality vs a Flatbed (Although I have to add that rotary diecutters are the standard and usually do a fantastic job). Flatbed diecutters can offer more precise, consistent boxes. Flatbed diecutters are more rare, so your provider may not have one available. \n\n3rd. You mention the difference in the \"quality\" of the paper. This could be that the Synology box is a higher paper strength than yours. I find that heavier paper combinations do have more of a \"premium\" feel to them, and you will certainly have a stronger box as a result. \n\nAll of these things I have mentioned will result in higher costs... So the question you have to answer for you and your company is how much is a higher quality box worth to you? Would you be willing to double your packaging costs to get this higher quality?",

                "content": "You need to dig deeper into corrugated board specifications. Box makers usually have a few different options for the same flute and thickness, since every corrugated board layer can be made of different paper liners with different qualities. \n\nFor the best quality you need to ditch anything that is recycled and move to more cellulose based options (kraft). If you are worried about the trees ask for FSC or PEFC certified material. Read about ECT (edge crush test). Higher ECT number means better quality board. Also be prepared for a price shift, because higher ECT + KRAFT usually means higher material price. \n\nThe horror sample in your photo clearly shows a few things:\n\n1. Flute direction of the box is wrong. You want your fluting to be perpendicular to double crease lines, which helps to achieve nicer double fold. Your box looks like a modification of FEFCO 0471 standard model to make it look more like a FEFCO 0427, but they kept a flute direction of FEFCO 0427.\n2. Board may be too weak for your prodoct and it tears and crashes from weight.\n3. Board may be ok, but there might be some problems with structural design, which makes your box fold bad. Your product may be badly fitted into insert and movement may tear something. But these things are too hard to confirm from photos only.",

Some only request size dimensions and say they have the ideal box, while others insist on receiving the product for testing and proper design. Since my product is quite fragile, I realize I need more than just a box, but I'm unsure whether to use cardboard inserts, soft packing foam, or molded styrofoam. There are different protection levels and costs involved, so testing seems necessary. Do you have any advice on how to choose void filling materials or secure features on my own? Is it worthwhile for small businesses to pay for ISTA testing during packaging design? Have any of you successfully conducted your own tests to validate your packaging? I have the skills to create cardboard templates for the inserts and think it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to conduct drop and vibration tests to find out what works.",

The design can convey a modern or classic feel, enhancing the overall appeal whether you're using elegant crystal holders or rustic mason jars.\n\n2. **Festive Holiday Packaging**: Enhance the holiday spirit with special packaging options. Seasonal candles make great gifts, and limited edition designs, like foil accents or themed boxes, can add a festive touch. For example, using snowflakes for winter or hearts for Valentine's Day can highlight the occasion.\n\n3. **Custom Candle Boxes**: Tailor your packaging to your brand's theme and colors. Custom boxes can showcase your vision and include details like ingredients, usage instructions, and design quotes, offering a unique and premium experience for customers.\n\n4. **Mailer Boxes for E-commerce**: For online sales, minimalist mailer boxes can improve shipping efficiency while protecting your products. Customize these boxes with your branding to enhance brand visibility and create excitement for customers awaiting their candles.",

What info is included on the outside of the box? What's included inside on any user manual type pamphlet? Having reference material is always helpful. Depending on what you expect the quantity to be on your first production run, I'd look into a rapid print type of place that does custom boxes. Somewhere like [this place ](https://designersfoldingbox.com/corrugated-boxes/) or [this one](https://www.printingplusink.com/). Both of these are places I've worked with, but they're east coast.

I\u2019m sure you could find a cheap copy online somewhere as well. \n\nMost of my knowledge comes from how the package might perform dynamically in a transport system like a pallet so I would keep in mind the weight of your product and the needed strengths of the material that the package will be made out of. For instance, a multi-pack might a double wall corrugated container rather than a single wall. \n\nSo, I think your best bet for this product would be to find a packaging consultant.

If we add a rigid board covered in foil, we get the benefit of a thicker material that also works as a thermal insulator to block any residual heat from the tray forming process. The rigid board gives enough pack stiffness that you require only very thin plastic, so the amount of heat/time required can be reduced accordingly.\n\nThese compound benefits mean the risks from thin, fragile product and temperature exposure are largely mitigated.\n\nThere could be other benefits, however I think you\u2019d need inherent knowledge of the applicable to have such information",

Think of like flash flooding, there\u2019s nothing stopping water. Water is powerful. So bundling it up essentially creates a wildly strong stacking strength. Makes me want to take a pack of water and put it on a compression table.\n\nBottles of beer in boxes, that takes the glass as a structural component. Think of the comparison of what will hurt more - if someone wearing a stiletto heal steps on you or an elephant. So basically because there are 12 structures within the pack. The weight from above is stretched across all the bottles and a little bit saved from the box they\u2019re in. \n\nCans are metal. I once did a compression test on a box of cookie tins, the deflection at around .25\u201d was about 1800 pounds, and those were on the side. So if you have stacked columns of it, it would probably be higher",

My gut says maybe consider some paper options since the damage risk during shipping probably isn\u2019t too high, but you want a nice unboxing experience. \n\nI\u2019d look into shredded crinkle paper, and if your require a bit more protection maybe look into wrapping your albums with honeycomb paper as well. I\u2019d pack some like this and see how much movement you get- if product is shifting a lot you may need regular Kraft paper instead of shredded crinkle. If so, the rolls are cheap and just crumple by hand. \n\nThese should be cheaper and less time consuming than foam, which I\u2019d assume you\u2019d be cutting to size by hand for each album.",

Within Artios you can filter by blank size, material, customer name etc. As long as the information is properly logged into the files (which it isn\u2019t always) everything is incredibly easy to find. Of course, this is limited to paperboard and corrugated based packaging and limited to the designers that have ArtiosCAD. \n\nAt my previous job they were all built into the production art files. For anything 3D (jars, bottles, thermoformed parts etc.) we\u2019re created in Solidworks or Fusion 360, exported as drawings and dropped onto production art files. All files were organized by customer and the first part of the SKU number indicated what material family the packaging was made of. There was no quick way to find anything. It was mostly built around somebody remembering that we designed \u201cx\u201dpackaging for \u201cx\u201d customer. \n\nFor both companies all files are given unique SKU numbers with revision number and letter at the end. They\u2019re then referenced in the company\u2019s database program under a unique job number which links to all the other information like quotes, job status, customer name etc. The spec information is logged in the database, but not linked to the design/spec files themselves. Which as a you can imagine can cause issues. \n\nI would imagine this^ is how most packaging companies operate but I\u2019ve only worked at 2 places so far. \n\nA few months ago I interviewed at a place that uses a software called Spec Right to manage their specs and track projects. I don\u2019t know much more than that and if it has any integration with design files that would prevent the issues mentioned above.",

We have three forklift operators handling three main tasks: 1) unloading stock from trucks and entering it into the system, 2) supplying the factory through another dock, and 3) conducting stocktakes, along with various housekeeping and warehousing duties. With only 1.5 years of experience in this role, I'm eager to enhance my knowledge of efficiency, particularly regarding safety, as we frequently encounter safety incidents that often lead to property damage.

We welcome suggestions for policies that can balance the valuable insights from vendors with the potential for overwhelming marketing content.",

This process is physically demanding for the person moving boxes from waist-height tables or carts to ground/dock level for customer pickup. We propose building carts at a height that aligns with gravity roller conveyors, which would slope down to dock height and include a 90-degree turn for easy access. Currently, we have about 8 to 12 feet for the decline, with some flexibility. Despite researching, I haven't found gravity roller conveyors that reach the floor. While I could consult a materials handling company, this project is small and might lead to unnecessary upselling. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.

We've been using the Tera mini wireless scanners, but we've had about two break within a week and one lose connection after a few seconds. While some workers preferred to stick with the old models due to resistance to change, I believe the two that broke were genuine accidents, as users pressed the buttons too hard and they caved in. This indicates a lack of durability. Although we advised users to handle them gently, one break involved a temporary worker. Given that we anticipate increased use during the holiday season, I want to find a more robust model. Currently, we primarily use EAN-13 and ITF-14 barcodes. Additionally, I learned just recently that the range of these scanners from the main device (an Android) is an issue. Many users keep the Android near their cart and only take the scanner when needed, sometimes leaving it at the beginning of the lane. We need a scanner that can maintain a connection at 5 to 6 meters, as the ones we have disconnect after about 1 to 2 meters.",

I was actually the first female ever to work in the warehouse at this company, so there were alot of mixed reactions from people. Some were very willing to help me, and others thought I had no place there. When I started, I wasn't very muscular and I'd say I could only comfortably lift at most maybe 45-55 pounds without struggling. I used to have to ask for help alot. Once you work there for a while longer, you'll start to know who you can go to for help and who you should avoid. When I started, I immediately got a sense as to who I could go to, so I always stuck with those same few people when it came to needing help. After being here for so many years, doing a couple different jobs around the shop, I've gained quite a bit more muscle and now I can comfortably lift 75-80 pounds. It's hard work, but the more frequently and the longer you keep it up, the easier it will become. In the meantime, maintain a well balanced diet, drink plenty of water throughout your day, and do not hurt yourself by attempting to lift something that you know you can't by yourself. Ask for help when you need it, and if someone gives you a hard time about it, go to your supervisor or if necessary, H.R. Good luck!!",

At least that's how it should be, warehousing jobs are a mixed bag.

How much of what comes in has to be raised to be stored and is that daily and how many pallets is that?  You want to get an idea of how much is moving and where it will go.  This will help identify if you need powered equipment, how much and what type. It\u2019s a good idea to have redundancy as mentioned already.  Manual pallet jacks are a cheap way to ensure product keeps moving on the floor.  If you go vertical you need a backup plan to retrieve pallets up high.  Do you have a neighbor with a forklift you can borrow last minute, or do you need your own backup onsite in your warehouse?  Also, what are you storing and will your racking be stronger enough to support it?  There are cheap pallet lifters, but weight capacity and lift height are both low.",

Ask them what they think may have caused this error. If their logic brings them to something like a pick or receive error, ask how they would prevent that from happening in the future.

                "content": "Bit of a disclaimer but I've never worked at O'Reilly, so here's my more general advice assuming you have a performance tracking system. \n\nIf the DC is worth its salt it'll have a decent training program. I'd say pace yourself. If it's similar to my job you won't have to work at 100% until six weeks after training. Even then, management usually doesn't care so long as they see consistent growth. I'm a slow learner, it takes me forever to master any job function. I just try to push myself to work better and faster each day.\n\nDon't work hard at the start if the system does track your performance, you want time to learn your job properly and then slowly try to get faster. I followed my trainer's advice which was to start at 55% and then each week increase by 5-10 percent.\n\nIf/when you are struggling to maintain 100%, I reccomend you just push yourself to keep moving. You should only ease up once you know that you can reach 125% working hard, and 100% is laughably slow for you.\n\nAlso ask the senior workers for advice. They'll have good tips and know the ins and outs of their jobs. They may not necessarily be friendly (especially while on the clock) but the good ones will give pointers that'll boost your efficiency.\n\nTake a supervisor's advice with a grain of salt. If they're ordering you to do something do it, but sometimes they can be really off mark with their suggestions.\n\nIn the beginning the more senior workers may seem very imposing and unfriendly. As long as you make an effort to keep out of their way, they'll learn to appreciate you. I still do that for others even though I can easily pull 120, because it generates a nice quid pro quo between Coworkers.\n\nThis is very general advice because I have no clue what job function you are doing, but I loosely based it on pallet assembly. Your trainor's advice and guidance trumps anything on the internet. Best of luck!",

I\u2019ve tried using gloves, but they slow me down, so I use carpenter gloves with half-fingers for my thumb, index, and middle fingers. Does anyone have suggestions? I've already asked in r/athletic training. Taping my cuticles doesn\u2019t hold up for long, and while liquid bandage helps, it takes too long to dry since I get paid per item. Is there a type of \"finger condom\" or thimble designed for people who frequently reach into boxes? Thanks!",

We had some high pressure sodium bulbs in one of our warehouses that went 15 years w/no replacement & were still going strong when we left, with the density of most warehouses the light intensity/color isn't a problem, but you may not have ballests that support them (so another $20-40 + labor ) take a look at the image here for an idea of what I'm talking about  https://oeo.com/high-pressure-sodium-bulbs-work-high-bay-lighting/   I'd say there should be a lighting retailer w/a height, gap, lumens calculator (and if not they now owe me a royalty)",

Any idea of which brands are the best for warehouse lightning? I think I will start outside of the warehouse, like the lights we use in the parking lot. The guy told me that the lights that they sell at Home Depot are trash, so any recommendations of which brand to consider? thanks!",

When I moved to produce, it was more of a temperature issue, touching frequently wet 1-4 degree product all the time saps away your body heat. A nifty trick as well when handling too much wet produce is to swap out my gloves, now my hands are back to being dry and warm. Now that I'm in the freezer, gloves (of course) are still important, but I only wear two pairs of fabric and use other clothing to keep warm.\n\nAs for enforcement, I'd say there should be none, just the option for workers to use them (ie company provided). I use gloves in all my warehouse tasks, from operating reach truck to assembling pallets, to loading and recieving. I find gloves to mostly be the catch all to repetitive injuries on hands. Box cuts are impossible, and knife cuts are reduced (I've accidentally slashed my hands without getting cut). Anecdotally, when I see others that injure their hands, they usually aren't wearing gloves. That trend, however, may be because accident prone workers don't think/care to wear gloves.\n\nAt first using gloves is more difficult to assemble (pallets) with, but within a week I learned how to easily pick up boxes with little grip (tilt and grab).",

        "content": "I'm at a loss. We recently switched to a new TMS that batch ships via UPS and FedEx, limiting our ability to customize reference fields for each box. Each shipment has two reference numbers: our internal order number and the customer PO number. In contrast, our old TMS shipped items individually, allowing us to include each item's ID on the label. Currently, we batch pick small parcel orders daily to optimize our warehouse picking path. While we can match labels to orders, we can't identify which label corresponds to each box within an order. Right now, we\u2019re manually matching label dimensions to items and writing the Item ID on each label for correct box placement. There must be a more efficient way to handle this, but I'm stuck. Does anyone have insights or experiences to share? Thanks.",

        "content": "# Managing a Successful Warehouse Operation\n\nWhat key areas should managers focus on? Here\u2019s a summary along with links to detailed articles. While setting up a warehouse may seem straightforward, the complexity arises from the many tasks involved. Often, warehouse managers encounter issues because they overlook some critical aspects of operation.\n\n## Begin with an Effective Warehouse Layout\nIn a slow-moving warehouse, layout may not seem crucial, but as activity increases, inefficiencies become apparent, such as bottlenecks, cross-traffic, lost items, and inadequate quality control. An efficient warehouse layout creates a smooth flow of goods, minimizing unnecessary movement. Additionally, ensure proper equipment for storage, handling, packing, and inventory control.\n\n## Prioritize Warehouse Safety\nSafety incidents can severely disrupt operations, and the warehousing industry has a higher fatal injury rate than the national average. Key hazards include dock accidents, forklift mishaps, conveyor injuries, improper material storage, and manual lifting issues. Prioritize safety training and incorporate safety measures into your warehouse setup from the start.\n\n## Provide Comprehensive Employee Training\nTraining is vital for both safety and efficiency. Ensure your staff is well-versed in packing methods, forklift operation, and quality control processes. Effective training enhances speed, reduces errors, and promotes a safer work environment.\n\n## Explore Small-Scale Automation\nWarehouse automation often involves specialized machines for repetitive tasks rather than complete robotic systems. Examples include automatic box builders and computerized quality control. Such automation can enhance productivity without replacing human workers.\n\n## Optimize Employee Management\nHiring the right number of workers and efficiently managing their schedules is essential. Monitor performance to identify improvements, such as differences in task completion times and workflow efficiency.\n\n## Efficient Inventory Management\nBalancing pick velocity with available space is key to effective inventory management. Adhere to core rules for inventory control to avoid issues associated with overstocking or understocking.\n\n## Continuously Seek Efficiency Improvements\nLook for bottlenecks and inefficiencies in operations. Implement solutions such as barcode systems, staging areas, and improved signage to enhance productivity.\n\n## Prepare for Successful Warehouse Management\nUnderstanding these seven areas can make warehouse management more manageable. Explore our resources on warehouse operations to enhance your efficiency and profitability.",

We need to cut metal rail to these sizes, but in Sage, we track our inventory by total lengths of rail in stock. For example, if we have five 1-meter lengths, we record it as 5 \"units.\" Since products often require custom sizes, we end up with shorter lengths that appear as stock but aren't usable for larger products, as we can\u2019t combine several shorter lengths. For instance, if we purchase 6m of rail and use 5m, we show 1m left in stock. The issue arises when we have multiple 1m lengths, leading us to mistakenly believe we have more total usable length than we actually do. This has happened repeatedly with various products, and we haven't found a solution other than scrapping old rail and manually adjusting our inventory. Does anyone have suggestions on how to manage stock for this type of product?",

For example anyone can type out posts but not everyone can write a novel or an article that is enjoyable to read. Having a computer does not make you a writer. But it is a good tool for writing. There are levels of effectiveness. A good process aims for an acceptable balance of investment vs value. Be it labor, training or equipment. \n\nIt's all about the process. What I've had to deal with is poor training and lack of standards. For example we have a %100 pack scan on orders being shipped out. Great. But the people doing the scanning are not well trained. Management operates under the fallacy that  have the scanner makes everyone %100 perfect. I had an order for a $300 item and a $10 item that was missing the $300 item. Upon investigation, I found that the packer had dumped both items out, scanned the $10 item and put the $300 item in the carton to be shipped. Then scanned the $10 item again and sent it back as a mis-pick. Calling for the $300 item to finish the order.  The only reason this time was caught is because that was the only one we had left. They lost track of where they were because they didn't have a good process in place to make use of the technology. \n\nAnother example, had an order that needed an item. Oddly we should have 4 two for the order and 2 left. Upon inspection, the picker had picked a case of 4 as 1 unit. The packer, not knowing any better had scanned the barcode on the case and incorrectly thought it was 1 unit of sale. Neither person was properly trained to know what they were looking at. But the scanner accepted what it was told. 1 scan = 1 unit.",

        "content": "I recently started as a Quality Engineer at a gasket manufacturing company. The operators primarily rely on paper records, leading to poor visibility regarding who was working and the materials used when customer issues arise. We have around 100 presses, both automated and manual, that process rubber compounds and sometimes include metal inserts for added structure. After production, gaskets may undergo additional curing and quality checks. Our suppliers, which may be external companies or our own branches, provide the rubber and inserts, each batch having a unique barcode. However, tracking who produced what and when is challenging. Operators create vague \"P-charts\" that only cover 2-hour intervals. For instance, while an operator can make 500 gaskets in that time, they only note the box numbers of the inserts used, not where the finished products go afterward. This situation is quite problematic. I\u2019m considering automating the process by implementing barcode scanners at each station for rubber reels and insert boxes, allowing operators to scan materials as they use them and finished products as they create them. I assume each station would need a computer and possibly a label printer, which we currently lack. What would the estimated cost for such a project be, and how can I find someone to assist with this? Are there any relevant subreddits for information? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

                "content": "If you want to be able to trace quality by batch, back to process, you're basically talking about detailed lot control. Each group of gaskets is made on x/date/time and you can capture this by barcoding the boxes the finished products go into. Part of your lot # scheme can be date/time/machine/process/production line etc.. - \n\nThen you should track who works when via time tracking system or assign people ID codes and have them scan in/out of jobs/machines/processes. Have a question about a gasket, scan its lot # and then check time/date/machine/line etc.. against whoever was working at that time.\n\nThere's a lot of out of the box systems that do this type of thing, but most of them want to add a billion other functionality points so it's hard to find one that small scale (ie affordable) and that just manages this type of thing.\n\nWe eventually wrote our own system to bolt on to our proprietary WMS/ERP system.\n\nAll product gets a receipt bar code when it comes in if it doesn't already have lot #'s from the mfg.\n\nUser gets a RFID card, we setup simple Wifi readers at every \"work\" location, and they scan in and scan out of jobs. That gives us which employee was working on what when. Then product lot #'s tell us when the product came in, when it was broken up (breaking up the lot creates new sub-lot #'s) and what process was being done to that lot at what time. \n\nQuery the two for a specific location/process/time and you get who was doing what, to what part of what lot, at what time.\n\nThis is really a simple process, the big hassle is setting up the workflow and getting people to adhere to scanning in/out of jobs. And of course depending on how many job/work locations and machines you have, setting up the hardware can be costly, but you can go standard barcodes and eliminate the RFID costs entirely. \n(Ie Bob gets a user barcode printed and stuck on a plastic card and \"Press Machine #1\" has a barcode on it, and when he starts working he has to scan his code and the machine code to \"Check in\" to the job, and then scan out when done. \n\nThis can be accomplished either by cheap mobile devices (tablets/phones with wifi or a $10 bar code reader attached to a cheap PC or thin client) or you can even do it on simple PC's and save it off daily to removable media if you don't have a wifi/netowork infrastructure.",

They usually have new/used racking you can purchase from them and they can be contracted for racking tear downs and may even buy up your used racking for resale. If I were in your position I might Google for those locals and see if they'll send someone out to inspect your warehouse and give you a quote. I was not involved in that process for very long, so unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with the process.",

My task is to reorganize the warehouse and implement a new inventory system that includes bar-coding and logging all existing items. This is a significant challenge due to the wide variety of products, such as pool components and different brands. I'm unsure where to start and would appreciate any advice. Should I focus on organizing the warehouse first or bar-coding everything before organizing?

Previously I worked for a CCTV distributor and many of the cameras were in identical boxes and often differed in code by one digit so that led to picking issues.\n\nIt may work to have everything sectioned by product types for your business but I've found mixing products helps picking speed and avoids errors. E.g a location with one pump type, one sink type & one plug type will be easier to see what you are looking for than three different types of pump in similar packaging.\n\nMost ideal thing would be to take a few days to do an undisturbed full audit. Set up the locations during work hours and then close up for a day and count everything where it is. If you have your inventory exported to a spreadsheet you can log the locations and tally how many of each product is in each place and directly import the data back into your inventory system. If it does not allow products to be stored in multiple locations you can task staff to combine them afterwards. A spreadsheet will also keep a running tally on unders/overs which you can investigate.\n\nIf you need to do a rolling count, I'd say to set up the locations, clear a section on shelving and one by one count everything into the empty shelves and update as you do, then you can theoretically shift the stock along as you go. This can be tricky if you are having to pick the stock at the same time.\n\nApologies if that's a bit sweeping, it may work as you said and another post menetioned, to group certain things together by product-type but the above is my personal experiences.\n\nThe biggest challenge may be getting the staff on board especially if they aren't used to things changing. Counting is tedious but the payoff is important and satisfying. Maybe ask them first what the issues are, I find bribes of biscuits and snacks often helps!",

                "content": "Seperating by brand first and then you have a choice to organize by sequence or product\nWhen you organize by product you run the risk of mispicks because products may look identical except the part number. If you organize by numerical sequence, your overall understanding of locations will greatly improve over time. In terms of bringing on new product... Expect to be changing item locations because making room for the new product usually \"snakes\" theproduct further away from the beginning of the manufacturers designated isle. With sequencing you risk mispicks based on the idea that one part sitting next to the other could be one single digit different and can be confusing. The other problem with sequencing is that generally you will have two areas for each (main) manufacterer. Why? Because there are small parts and large parts. You absolutely want to seperate those in the case of limited space. My warehouse is also a retail enviroment in the front so it may be a little different for us.\n\nI manage a warehouse that sells toilets, pool chemicals aswell as anything related to plumbing and appliance parts.\n\nToilets are considered and handled more as bulk. Your toilets are sold in two pieces.. Tank and bowl right? It should be clearly defined and staged for picking in a way that is completely clear they match. \n\nPool chemicals are a beast in their own respect. At least at our company.  Part numbers are notoriously complex and not labeled very clearly. Do your best to create labels for pool chemicals that look similar to others. Same of the toilets our bromine,soda ash, sodium bicarb are treated as bulk as well. We keep one full pallet on the ground. It should be located somewhere accessible to pick as well as replenish. \n\n\nThere is a report you need to get your hands on. . . This is going to put your warehouse layout at optimal effectiveness and will help you to develop flow. \n\nObtain a report that indicates how often parts are sold. What you are looking for is parts that are constantly sold and reordered. I recommend having an area dedicated \"fast moving\" product and keeping that close to your processing area as to avoid unneccisary wasted travel time. \n\nWill update somemore but gonna run for now. I hope that helps.\n\n*I was offered a warehouse management position last year at 25 after ths previous manager spent the last six months of his 8 year career running the place into the ground. I'm happy to say it was one of the most challenging things I have overcome. Here we are a year later and I am still always doing whatever U can do makemy warehouse better. In fact I have earned the respect from three other warehouse managers within our company (10 plus years of tenure) who truly appreciated my insight. So I am trying to give you some useful stuff here.

I've suggested disabling the ability to manually enter locations, but many barcodes are malfunctioning, and we're working on fixing that.

They conduct initial counts near the locations, and for items over $100, I try to track their history to find likely spots. Unfortunately, this approach only retrieves about 60% of the items, and we\u2019re falling behind due to staffing shortages. I'm seeking advice on these specific issues or general tips for inventory management. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to contributing to this community.",

This was all pen and paper so using the gun may work to help speed up this process. But for those that have barcode issues, you need to figure out how to get a printout of cycle counts. \n\nMy cycle count sheet indicated price of items so in order to speedily get through the most high value items, I skipped anything short of $80. \n\nOnce the numbers are recorder, if you must need a computer to change counts, you'll want to do it immediately after you do a single or small set of shelf. Why? Because inventory changes constantly  so it is important to have these numbers be a true reflection immediately.  \n\nFrom that point on, I did regular cycle counts and pinpointed particular locations that seemed to have to most issues. Evaluated the storage and location of the item and often moved it to make more sense. \n\nAs for people not putting stuff back where it belongs and just simply adding new locations, the team lead needs to step in and restrict the right to relocate parts to restricted access. Too many hands in the pot and obviously to much room for error. \n\nI hope that helped in some way!",

This zone is for pallets that can't be put onto racking for any reason. Inventory control can then figure out what is wrong with said pallets (bad barcodes, unsafe pallet, ect.) fix it and get a fork operator to clean up said pallets once the issue is resolved (as a new task for putaway).\n\nLike others mentioned use checkdidgits instead, that way location tags can last longer. Also how is efficiency tracked on replen? If it's similar to where I work travel time should be given for correct placement of pallets, and it should be cut for closer (ie. overridden) locations (but don't give time for further location overrides, thats how order fillers started travelling to the opposite side of the warehouse to print out their OLN where I'm at).\n\nTake my suggestions with a grain of salt, Im just a general labourer that likes his current warehouse system.",

The down side is it can be a little bit of a learning curve. It's completely customizable for your company and its needs, but that makes the menus a little confusing and repetitive at times, and when something goes wrong it can be a bit of a pain it figure it out. It's worth learning, bit hopefully your company has a \"NetSuite Guru\" type figure to help get y'all initially set up and help with any integration issues you may have. The shipping process has a lot of steps, from picked to packed to shipped, but once you get it down it's rather handy.",

                "content": "First of all lets all agree on verbiage... many times I run into people who use SKU/ID/UPC/internal PN/Barcode interchangably.\nUPC= Universal Product Code, This is issued by the central GTIN authority and it's same number everywhere ( Best Buy, Wal-Mart, websiteIjustmadeupmomandpop.com. etc..)\n\nSKU's are Stock keeping units, and aren't universal. (usually unique in every step of the chain (mfg/3pl/retailer/etc..)\n\nSo for product A, that has UPC A1, Best Buy, Wal-Mark, and davesjunk.com all have different SKU's and then you have one as well. (I usually refer to SKU's as external, and part number as internal but that's just me)\n\nMost inventory ordering and control systems will let you setup an inventory cross reference where you can put in one/many of the numbers plus qualifiers. This helps when you're dealing with large qty's of parts as some mfg's will have the same sku for part A that another mfg has for part D. (we've run into mfg's that accidentally use the same SKU twice on their own different products) so it's always good to have a central tie in to your vetted part.\nThen all your lookups work the same way. (You lookup your internal part 123 and it shows you the 12/13/14 digit UPC's, and all your specific SKU's and who they belong to, or vica versa)\nThis really helps if you have inbound orders from multiple people as they can all use their own numbers and it all xrefs back to your part and is used/shipped/sold accordingly.\n\nDo your parts have any barcoded info on them for the UPC or SKU? Barcoding or RFID is IMHO essential for tracking all inbound, internal and oubound product actions. ( receipt/storage/move/shipping/selling/returns/repairs etc..)\n\nHow are you currently tracking those 20K parts? other than your \"misc\" PN\nIf someone needs a part do they have a desciption or anything to go off of or are they digging through piles?\n\nHow many mfg's are you dealing with? Sometimes you can get a dump from the mfg with inventory lines in a .csv and then you could just clean up, add xref's, margin etc..as needed\n\nSome Niche web products will do mass part lookups and imports off UPC's, but in most cases you just have to make \"Add the SKU/UPC/other/other\" part of your \"Add new part to the system\" checklist. And/or do a full physical with barcoding/labeling the parts and locations as part of that.\n\nMy suggestion without knowing all the details... Come up with a internal part number nomenclature and tie your part number to your mfg's sku's and UPC's. Barcode it if it's already in your physical, and add barcodes to anything coming in the doors. Get data files for imports where you can, then get an intern to do data entry for the rest.",

If you have one person constantly mis-picking through the month, time to have a talk with them. (Or a monthly $20 Amazon gift card for people with zero pick errors) etc..\n\nQuaternary check:  \n\nIf it's a huge issue with high value product, or you're seeing shrink,.. cams at packout to see who packed what.

Remember we are not talking about cases, these are random single items. \n\nI would suggest you use scan to pick and scan to pack. It might not seem worth the trouble if you're small and you only have a few items at a time but if you get big, it'll be more costly and disruptive to re-train and alter workflow later.  \n\nFor DTC orders we use 100% scanning and for retail replenishment we use single scan verification.

With a rate system the cheating gets baked in at some point. \n\nIf an item cannot be located then we exception the order and investigate any possible inventory variance. \n\nWe use a homebrew WMS.",

Maybe you have a mix of both.\n\nCould also depend on how your facility is laid out. For example we only have 1 forward pick location for each item but some people use multiple locations. One or more of these could easily be overlooked when counting. Also do you operate more than one building? Inventory could be found in the wrong one.\n\nWe still do an annual inventory which can be a bear. We have pick bins, and whole case backstock. We do a quarterly cycle count of backstock.\n\nIn the forward pick bins we have issues with;\n\n* The shelf count differs from the record count. \n* Damaged items. (sometimes these are counted and then removed, causing a variance.) \n* Inactive items found that are not in our current inventory. \n* Unit of sale not counted correctly. (This is always confusing a simple way to think of it is if you have shoes sold by the pair and someone counts each pair as 2 shoes.)\n* Inaccurate counts (need to have a good audit process in place for this.) \n* Re-shelving that is still in process not included in the final count. \n* Damaged or missing bins that exist on paper which need to be located. \n* Bins that physically exist but are not do not on paper.\n* Items from mixed/mislabeled cases that we don't carry/sell. \n\nCycle count issues in backstock are tricky as well, we use a random allocation system based on license plates. This can cause a lot of issues when cycle counting. Most stem from either a bad read on the scanner or an error from the cycle counter. We use code 3of9 barcodes with an alpha/numeric, no check digit. The Motorola MC9000s we have are very prone to misreads on this symbology. I believe our printer font is the issue. Anyway, we also face issues caused by hand keying errors and procedural errors when counting.\n\nIssues we often see are; \n\n* Scanner misreading the barcodes. \n* Lost LPs (Most often a missed scan.) \n* Duplicate LPs. \n* LP is moved from one location to another, depending on how far it moved this could be an error or a duplicate. \n* LPs are found that the system thinks are in another warehouse. \n* Old LPs are reactivated. (Should already have been consumed.) \n* Cases are found that don't have an LP. (May be a missing label or not in the inventory.) \n* Cases are found with more than one LP. (This is often an error in receiving.)\n\nThese all have to be investigated.",

We currently have a salesman who also acts as a delivery driver, which has helped us save on freight costs while allowing him to sell on-site. We want to continue this approach for local sales. Right now, we use a spreadsheet to track orders, deliveries, and resupplies for the products on the van, aiming to reflect the actual inventory. However, after doing a physical count, I found that nearly half of the inventory items showed negative amounts compared to what the spreadsheet reported. It's clear we're losing products, and I believe we can improve our inventory management. The basic spreadsheet might be part of the issue, making it difficult to identify the exact cause of the discrepancies. Do you have suggestions for improving our spreadsheet management or alternative inventory tracking solutions? Thanks for your help!",

You can even have the barcodes appear on your sales invoice to \"scan out\" against to triple check that the right product goes to the right order.\nCell phone + $35 bluetooth barcode scanner.\n\nIf they still have negative numbers, they're stealing, giving it away, or someone is looting your trucks.\n\nThe next, more expensive solution, (and the minimum I would suggest) would be to do the same thing behind a web app. (so it's a little more secure) and have that talk to a simple database behind the scenes for check in/out.\n\nPast that there's free online software (usually won't work the way you need it to and you'll have to shoehorn your process into their software or pay for mods) \n\nThen buying a full fledged WMS system.\n\nHope that helps.\n",

Each item's label will be scanned upon storage to maintain location accuracy. The database must enable us to assign items to specific dates and trailers, allowing the loading crew to scan items as they are loaded, ensuring only those for the designated trailer and date can be scanned to avoid errors. Customers should be able to check the receiving status of their items online to follow up with vendors if necessary.

We had a local battery place that had cheap off-brand batteries for it but it turned out we didn't have to spend the extra $200 on them as the ones in the unit were fine.\n\nUsed you can always find a good deal on these (REALLY good deals with batteries if you're local pickup as shipping costs a fortune) \n\nDisabled the no power alert via the software (Thanks youtube)\nAt night plug it in. Next day runs a laptop, external 24\" LED monitor, the portable zebra (w/wifi), a USB and a portable 2-d laser bar-code scanner for 8hr with zero issues. We do pretty consistent printing all day, but they do plug it back in for lunch, so it's getting 30-40min of boost charge a day. Though based on the usage chart, I don't think we need it. \n\nhttps://www.apc.com/products/runtimegraph/runtime_graph.cfm?base_sku=SUA3000XL-NETPKG&chartSize=large\n\nWe're talking about needing a standard inkjet or laserjet as well. Worst case, I'll buy another UPC and drop it on the bottom of the cart.\n\nOh, and keep a can of WD40 on hand (keep those wheels lubed good as people are pushing it around all day and it's not super light)\n",

        "content": "Good morning, I'm a 28-year-old male without a college degree or certifications. I have about a year of management experience and two years as a lead. In the last two years, I've worked at four different companies seeking a stable position. I spent two and a half years as a warehouse lead for a manufacturer, then worked for three months as a distribution manager for United Airlines, but left due to poor management and ethical concerns. After that, I was a supervisor at another manufacturer for eight months, co-managing a second shift of 30 employees. I left that role for a better work-life balance and now manage a warehouse for a trade show supplier, which I believe is a good fit for me. I earn $52,000 annually with minor bonuses, healthcare, and a 401K, and I\u2019m on a first shift with most weekends off. My strengths include process improvement and organization, and I\u2019m interested in Lean Six Sigma, though I lack certifications. I\u2019m skilled at managing and motivating staff. In seven years, I aim to earn $70,000 to $80,000 annually. \n\nI\u2019m considering a few options to achieve this:\n- Getting a degree, which I find daunting and concerning due to potential debt.\n- Earning certifications to enhance my experience, though I\u2019m unsure which ones are valued by employers.\n- Exploring a career in logistics, which seems lucrative and aligns with my skills in load planning and customer service.\n\nI'm seeking advice from warehouse managers on Reddit who earn over $70,000. How did you reach that salary? Given my background, what path would you recommend? I\u2019m open to sharing more details. Thank you!",

                "content": "I would go to your boss and see ask what the development path within the organization would be.  Then on your next appraisal create a personal development program.  Express direct interest to your superiors on becoming lean/ six sigma certified.  What about internal auditing?   What can you get your current company to pay for?  What gaps do you see in your day to day that you feel could be addressed?  Do you have the skill set to address these gaps?  What skills would you need to develop to address these gaps?\n\nHave you specifically developed any SOP's?  You say your strengths are process streamlining and organization.  Can you back that up w/ MRP data from pre/ post implementation?  What performance indicators did you use to evaluate any implemented programs?  How did you determine that they were applicable? \n\nSo overall I have 3 pieces of advice:\n\n1. Determine where you want to go.  Warehouse management has many different levels to it and your request seems fairly broad.  It seams like you are focused on actual management of workers.  IMHO (key word humble - i'm in pretty much the same place as you) you should try to separate from the actual hands on management and move more to data analysis\n\n2. Get applicable certifications that will help you in your current role.  These will be paid for by your employer and allow you to gain experience in what they are teaching you to do.  Don't go to culinary school if you aren't going to be a chef. \n\n3. document what you have implemented.  it is a lot easier to support yourself if you can say \"i implemented project xyz on the following date.  we were using the following factors to measure performance and these were our actual results.  we determined that we did/ did not meet our goals for the following reasons\"\n\nSo i've moved into quality management and it sounds like you are managing warehouses that are much larger than what I ever have, so take my advise with a grain of salt.  \n\nGood Luck",

When you go to pick you scan the product code (from the box) then scan the tote, and your system knows that the product is in the tote. A little more programming, but you're not printing as many labels. This would be the case is all, or a large part of your inventory was small or bulk inventory with small pick qtys.\n\nWe use hip printers for those types of situations but they're very rare as we reliably scan very small bad codes. We have QR codes that are about 1/2 the size of a postage stamp for our smaller products with no hassle. We also have standard barcodes as small as 1x2 w/little or no issues. A higher resolution printer works wonders for the smaller codes. We use 200dpi for standard codes and 300dpi for especially dense or small codes. And remember you can print very short height bar codes and still get reliable scans if your product is only short on L or H.",

When properly implemented, all areas of the company should be using one centralized system where there are quality control measures that keep inventory in control. i.e formal receiving and intake processes, inventory management (adjustments, cycle counts, damages etc) and it should also be able to direct workers on where to go and what to do when items need picked for an order. \n\nFrom experience, I can recommend this solution.

                "content": "Hey Relative_Tracker,\n\nI work for a company called Infoplus Commerce and we offer a cloud based Inventory management solution that tends to be perfect fit for online retailers. The system can be accessed anywhere there's an internet connection. We offer plug-n-play integrations with many large online shopping cart platforms (Shopify, Magento, Big Commerce, WooCommerce, Ebay, Amazon and many more)  As far as quality controls around your physical inventory, we do offer a full set of warehouse management features such as PO/Receiving, Item/Inventory management as well Orders & Pick/Pack/Ship features. \n\nIn regards to tying in your POS system, I can't speak to your specific use case without knowing more but we do currently have a client who has integrated their POS with their Shopify store front. Whenever a POS order is captured it is sent from their POS to their Shopify, and then sent from Shopify to Infoplus via our integration. Once POS orders land within Infoplus they are automatically routed to \"Virtual POS\" Warehouse where the inventory is decremented. This allows our customer to track sales and inventory records on an automated or ad-hoc basis in real time. \n\nCheck out the website below and sign up for a demo to learn more. At the very least our sales team can point you in the right direction! \n\nhttp://www.infopluscommerce.com/",

Alt, if the pallet is just a bulk container for true raw bulk materials, then the UOM still counts, but you may also be working with catch weights to allow for better handling. \n\nIn your example, let's say that we have an SKU \\(DIRT1\\).   \n\nDIRT1 could be setup as following \n\n\\- L\\-UOM \\(Lowest\\-Unit of Measure\\) = 1 lbs\n\n\\- Inner Pack = N/A\n\n\\- Case Pack = N/A\n\n\\- Pallet = 1,000 lbs\n\nAnd in the warehouse, we setup DIRT1 to be pickable in two different UOM\n\n\\- Pickable via Pallet \n\n\\- Pickable via lbs \\(with Catch Weights\\) \n\nWe receive in DIRT1 by the pallet.   At receiving, each pallet of DIRT1 is assigned an LPN \\(just a unique barcode for that pallet\\) and then put away in the warehouse \\(to one of several different types of locations depending on demand, etc.\\). \n\nPallet in and Pallet out picking \\- those pallets are stored in \"Pallet\" locations, which will only allow PIPO. \n\nLbs out picking \\- that will take place from a pallet that is stored in a \"Standard\" or \"Down Forward\" location \\(which is replenished from a PIPO location as needed\\)\n\nWith the above \\- then we can have the system generate proper pick work for us based on what is needed. \n\nLet's say that you are running a process that is requesting 1,200 lbs of DIRT1.   The system will then direct you to grab 1 Pallet of DIRT1 from a pallet location, and then to grab 200 lbs of DIRT1 from a Down Forward Location. ",

                "content": "We're doing retail Dist & 3PL to big box retailers, so keeping in mind that I'm \"The competition\" :) ....\n\nStarting a distribution business is the easiest thing in the world. \nA. get space. B. Fill space. C. move things in and out of space for money.\nThe devil is in the details.\n\nThe biggest things to consider for 3pl/dist/warehousing:\n\nA. Rent (warehouses are a lot of sqft with $$/sqft charges that add up. heating/cooling/cleaning/security etc... etc..) Also look at the price variances for WH rent in your area for 5, 10, 15 years. Economy swings can instantly kill an operation that uses a lot of space. We had a large warehouse in Ireland a long time ago and rent prices changed a great profit center to a huge money pit nearly overnight. If that had been all our business, we would have had to fold up the business entirely. \"I can get space dirt cheap\" (that means everyone else can too, who can afford to hang on longer when the prices climb?)\n  \nB. Location (to provide the best value, you need to be in a place that has easy access preferably for truck/rail and even ship/air if possible. How many days are you out from your farthest shipping point? Will people want to wait that long? Can your afford to make up the difference?\n  \nC. Filling the space (which pays for that rent): The mindset of \"If you build it they will come\" has ruined a lot of WH startups. You need to have a good idea of how much space you can have committed day 1 to offsetting your costs, and have a plan for turnover/landing new clients ongoing 100% of the time. (We don't feel comfortable unless we're constantly discussing \"Is this the month we need to get another location/build more racks etc.. etc..)\n  \nD. Pick/Pack/Ship operations. To do it right you need automation/equipment/people (printers/forklifts/scanners/etc.. etc...) The equipment costs for a *small* warehouse can quickly go over $100K\n  \nE. Competition. There's really not a lot of \"secret sauce\" in this game. Everyone knows how to do the job, and the only real differentiation is quality of service and pricing. So,.. can you out perform the bigger guys who are established already and provide customers with better pricing all the while employing people who won't walk off with inventory?  I know of companies that will actually give away warehousing to get \"Other business\" from their customers. Their warehouses are 100% write off. That's a vast minority, but If you have a few of those guys in your area it's nearly impossible to compete.\n  \nF. Customers - We're really lucky to have some customers that have been with us for over 20+ years, but a large part of the people shopping for warehousing and 3pl services don't think about this as a partnership, it's viewed more as a necessary evil that they're outsourcing (like cleaning the toilets) and as such, they will have no problem dropping you in a heartbeat for someone who gives them a slightly better rate on storage/shipping/labels/etc.. etc..\n\nThe biggest thing to consider for \"Retail\" dist/3pl/WH:\nand by far the biggest \"pain point\" of dealing with retail,.. is the Retailers.\n\nMake no mistake, there's money to be made doing retail distribution, but it's not a slam dunk by any means. \"Managing Retailer Expectations\" is a full time job for a team of people at the smallest end of the scale.\n\nEDI files have to be generated 100% perfectly /Perfectly timed/ with all the right acknowledgements for changes/cancellations etc.. etc..  (or else you get charge backs, which YOU pay out of pocket)\nSpeaking of charge backs,.. Are you ready to have X-Mart charge you $50 *PER CARTON* on a pallet with 200 cartons on it b/c the pallet was cracked. Or b/c a label was crooked, or the pack slip/BOL had incorrect information.\n\nHow about a charge per carton for the *entire truckload* (Which could be thousands of cartons) if you have it arrive to late OR too early by too many hours?\n\nChargebacks are the 2nd largest profit center for some of the big retailers,.. \n(I REALLY wish I was making this up) Retailers can be an awesome win. If you're setup to service them correctly you can get some great throughput, but I'm not kidding when I say one mistake can destroy your ROI for years, or put you out of business nearly instantly.\n\nIf I was cash flush & looking to do a startup, there are much quicker/easier ways that incur less risk and provide a better profit on the list before you get to doing Dist & warehousing.",

(Ie NEVER let a shipment with this destination address ship, never allow payments originating in this location to be processed etc... Red flag/notify if x, if y , if z. I think you'll have as many ERP/Financial requirements as WMS requirements, but nowadays there's a lot of overlap and combo systems that handle WMS and ERP functionality. Your budget is prime small/mid sized business cloud solution range, but any cloud solution may have regulatory issues dealing with your products, so you'll really have to vet all the related T&C with anyone cloud based. Of course you can do an \"on-premise\" install, then just host it on *your* cloud account as well if you have to. For shipping,.. take advantage of volume discounts, I'd suggest partnering with someone Like Connectship (have them do all the work to integrate the shipping logic and workflow as part of the sign up,.. you want to automate all that stuff based on your lowest cost to whatever the destination is)  As you mentioned,.. I can't over emphasize bar coding ALL products and move related processes and making sure product is \"received in\" and \"shipped/checked out\" systematically for all cases. Another *must have* Look for something that has \"Lot control\" (used in food and medical industries) in the event something happens w/your product, you need to be able to isolate the supplier, the breakdown, all the places it is and/or went to separate from the rest of your inventory (so you don't have to do a 100% recall/destroy/inspect) only the affected products are dealt with limits liability. And on the plus side,.. In the wine world those w/dates tie into expiration/freshness/vintage information for consumption so I'm sure the same applies here.",

Cloud options are going to be cheaper/more reliable than getting someone to build something, and you'll have support, most will scale and worst case scenario make sure they have good export options so if you buy something bigger/better you can just export from system A. and import into system B.\n\n2. it's absolutely better to have this, just to save time/effort. Either you get them in one package (something like Camelot) or you have to do the work (or pay someone to do the work) to make them talk to each other. But most WMS's have some kind of hooks or exports to XML/.csv's so it will be doable either way.\n\n3. You want a system that knows how to deal with \"BOM's\" (Bill of materials) type products. (Ie you have a finished good part (Part 123 \"Black Leather office chair\") and then you have component parts (Part 123a \"Black left armrest\")  You can use these as assembly type orders (WMS will let you pre-format all the components that go into a finished good so you can check to see if you have all the component inventory to make 2, 20, 200 chairs and which parts you'd need to order additionally to make the most finished goods) Or you can just treat them like spare parts inventory. (ie you sell the chairs and people can order the arm rests if they want to, or only your authorized chair service center customers can order the arms etc.. etc..)\n\nSo you your case you'd have finished good \"123 Mechnical seal\" with the 2 components \"124 Rotating portion\" and \"125 Stationary Portion\". You can put an order into the system for \"Mecanical Seal\" and it will look at the BOM and automatically pull the two (1x124 1x125) parts from inventory. Then you may have the part \"133 Mechanical Seal #2\" that has the components \"124 Rotating portion\" and \"126 Extended Stationary Portion\". Ordering this part looks at the BOM and grabs the two (1x124, 1x126) components to make it up.\n\nMost WMS's allow you to add different locations. You'll want something with the ability to set Min/Max inventory with replenishment. (ie I want a minimum of qty 10000 of part \"123 Mechanical seal\" at location A at all times. I'm down to 9000 and I need to get 1000 from warehouse B to replenish. Or I need 1000 of component \"124 Rotating portion\" from warehouse B and qty 1000 of component \"125 Stationary Portion\" from warehouse C to replenish. \n\nAs I say to everyone. Barcode EVERYTHING (finished goods, components etc..) and Scan things into/out of processes. Receive everything into the system when it comes in, and check/ship everything out of the system when it goes out. Do that early on and you avoid a million headaches down the road.",

I previously suggested that another manager train the selectors on properly pulling cases (bags) to prevent tearing from the corners, which had some success, but the issue has resurfaced. I\u2019m considering proposing the hiring of someone to work in the bagged aisles (three in total) to help level the pallets, since selectors tend to pull the bags that are most accessible, even if they are stacked under many other bags, leading to tears.",

Developing the system was challenging due to the multi-company setup with shared warehouses and inventories. It includes a web app for order management and an iOS app to assist warehouse employees with barcode picking. The owners are pleased with my demonstrations and want to test the system with actual orders to see if a full transition is feasible. I've been using inexpensive Bluetooth barcode scanners for these demos, but I believe the next step is to purchase an integrated barcode scanner case, so employees don't need to manage two devices. I found three major companies that offer such cases: Infinite Peripherals, Koamtac, and Honeywell. I would appreciate any insights or experiences you might have with these products before I invest over $600 in a case. Thank you!",

        "content": "My company uses Infor for inventory management, but it's inadequate for our warehouse needs, as it only provides total product counts without specifying quantities in each bin. We face issues like inaccurate inventory counts, leading to wasted time. Currently, we update our inventory manually with pen and paper before entering it into a large Excel file, which is error-prone. The Excel file only indicates potential bin locations for items, causing our warehouse team to spend excessive time checking stock and updating the file.\n\nWith over 2,000 rack spaces and limited room, we often have to consolidate items. I've seen other warehouses effectively using barcodes on products, pallets, and rack locations for tracking. I envision a system where every received item is scanned and placed on a pallet, with the pallet's barcode linking to a cloud-based WMS. This would allow me to track item locations efficiently, even for pallets temporarily stored on the ground, which should have their own barcodes.\n\nI'm seeking a modern solution that integrates with our Infor system to ensure accurate inventory updates for our sales team. I'm considering warehouse management systems that can sync with Infor, as well as exploring ERPs, but I'm uncertain about the best options and their costs. Any guidance would be appreciated!

I have about 10 years of warehousing experience in various roles like picking, packing, and shipping. Currently, my job is a mix of management and entry-level tasks, where I can't hire or fire, have no purchasing power, and report to the quality manager for warehouse layout. However, I'm responsible for daily operations, create my own schedule, and oversee temporary employees without direct hiring authority. \n\nThe new position would give me full responsibility for four full-time staff, including hiring, firing, ordering, ensuring we meet metrics, and conducting performance reviews. While I\u2019m not guaranteed the job, things look promising, and I believe I can handle it due to my intelligence, sense of responsibility, and attention to detail. This role represents a significant increase in responsibility, with my direct supervisor located at corporate HQ. \n\nDoes anyone have advice or insights on what to watch out for or lessons learned from first-time management experiences? I want to prepare thoroughly to give my best effort. The work involves straightforward tasks like picking, packing, receiving, and inventory management. Thank you in advance!",

                "content": "First, let me say CONGRATULATIONS on earning a great promotion in an excellent career field!\n\nSome things to consider:\n****\n\n1. The #1 responsibility of a Manager is to deliver results through other people.  How they do it is the difference between a good and bad Manager.\n\n1. The best Managers understand that employees are valuable people with skills, not people with valuable skills.\n\n1. The #1 skill a Manager should learn is how to hire the correct person for the job.  The #2 skill a Manager should learn is how to properly motivate that person.  The #3 skill a Manager should learn is how to let a person go, with grace and dignity, quickly, who is not working out.\n\n1. Know your P&L metrics and what things, while not quite metrics, really impress your boss (going out of your way for a customer, always on time with reports, time clock is always accurate, etc.).\n\n1. Take a look at the Performance Appraisal for your job, so you know what you will be specifically graded on.\n\n1. Cycle count your inventory with ruthless consistency and research variances outside of acceptable deviation.  Know what happened before your boss asks.\n\n1. Keep your equipment routinely maintained and your safety records (from weekly meetings to ratings) immaculate.\n\n1. Keep every piece of inventory accounted for in a bin location in your computer system.\n\n1.  In a warehouse with a few employees, it is important to lead from the floor, not the office, unless otherwise stated.  You should lead by example, be the first to pitch in, and heap praise on those who go above and beyond.\n\n1. Grab hold of free podcasts, like \"Manager Tools\", to learn a **system** of management.  Management skill **isn't** something you either have or don't have, **management skill is learned** - and there are some easy-to-learn ways to get it right.\n\n1. Most employees want a boss, not a buddy, no matter what they say to your face.  You can't be an effective leader if you are afraid to upset your employees with longer hours or the occasional weekend work.  If you were buddies before, be prepared for some distance as you transition into being the boss.\n\n1. Managers earn their money when it's hard. If you don't know what that means yet, you'll understand it over time.\n\n1. Finally, it doesn't matter what the company culture is at the Corporate office.  If you are managing a remote warehouse, you can choose and foster your own culture.  Pick one that leaves your team tired but happy and fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\n****\n\nsource: My own opinions, from my experience managing 300+ warehouse employees at 9 locations in positions ranging from Team Lead, Supervisor, Manager, Regional Manager and Division Manager.  I am currently the Chief Operating Officer.",

        "content": "I work with a business that sells bowling equipment and accessories by liquidating closeouts, overstocks, and open box items from across the USA. They bring these items to their warehouse, quickly select the high-value products for their physical store, and auction off the rest. The store has its own warehouse and inventory system, so items are essentially considered sold once shipped. Managing this like a typical warehouse seems too time-consuming, but I\u2019m unsure how to track inventory without following standard procedures. We label received products with removable labels indicating their storage location, then put them away. At auction, we scan the buyer's pickup sheet for a directed pick. Since all items received will be gone in 14 days\u2014either sent to the store, auctioned, destroyed, or donated\u2014I wonder if there's a quicker way to manage this, especially since it's all \"no returns.\" Finance receives a record of items in versus those sold, destroyed, or moved, so there's no need to retain that data either. I'm looking for workflow changes that would better fit this business model.",

(The removable labels is a bonus and I always suggest that to people. (In the event inventory has to move, or has expiration dates, has a \"consumer ready\" package etc..)  \n\nII. Directed putaway means your system \"knows where the product is\" at pick time, then when you pick you know where to go...\n  \n\nThe only thing I can think of that might speed up your process,.. if your auctions aren't live (like you win your auction today pick up tomorrow, 2 days later etc..) then you could pick each \"winner's items\" into a lot, then have those lots staged so you wouldn't have to wait till they give you the sheet, then pick through your inventory. You'd just have it all ready to go (by bidder name/number etc..) if they don't pick up put it in a quarantine area and start charging them storage fees if you don't already.",

I have a lot of smaller clients who use [Delivrd](http://www.delivrd.com/). It's free to use up to 25 items, so no reason not to check it out.\n\nNext up the ladder would be fishbowl, then if you're serious something like Camelot.",

                "content": "Hey hey! \n\nI'm kind of with Hatelabs on this one in that it seems unfeasible that you'll actually be better off insourcing. Here's why:\n\n*  10 grams is light as heck. You're well under 1 lb. With most fulfillment centers, you're in the sweet spot, since they will almost always get excellent rates on packages under a pound. Furthermore, and more importantly, they will likely get better rates than you'll get. \n\n*  150 orders per day is outstanding volume for a small eCommerce store. Full disclosure, I work for a fulfillment center, and we definitely offer reductions on pick/pack fees with volume that high. Does your 3PL do that? \n\n*  You require very little storage space per SKU. \n\nAnyway, I'll tell you that I think you'll find Shipstation to be a good source. I recommend them, personally, for an inventory/fulfillment solution. \n\nThe key, however, is that picking, packing, negotiating rates, etc. is pretty expensive at best and time consuming at worst. This is time you can spend increasing your edge in the marketplace! \n\nSo if you decide to explore other options for fulfillment, check us out over at [ShipMonk](https://www.shipmonk.com). And if not, I definitely recommend Shipstation. :) Good luck out there!",

For instance, I have to deliver seven appliances in one day, and I also need to pick up the old appliances at each stop. I want to ensure that by the time I reach the seventh delivery, the last fridge isn\u2019t buried behind the old ones. What is the best way to load and rearrange the trailer to avoid excessive shuffling at each stop? I appreciate any help or guidance. Thank you!",

Or if it's a small town deliver them all then pick them all up but that isn't really a good idea none of them are really. \n\nThere is one way to do this though. A flat bed, or a box truck with a side door. Then you can unload from the back and load from the side while pushing them out. Or vice versa. ",

I'm developing a robot that can autonomously pick up boxes and pallets to streamline inventory retrieval. However, I've noticed existing systems (like this one) and am grappling with the common challenge in tech development: creating something impressive that may not be needed. How viable is my idea? Would you consider investing in robots for moving boxes, or is it impractical given existing solutions? My robot is designed with wheels, arms, and navigation capabilities, essentially functioning as a self-driving forklift. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts\u2014please add me on Skype for a 15-minute chat at hellosir1337. Additionally, if anyone in the UK is open to it, I\u2019d love to volunteer for a week to understand warehouse workflows better. Thank you!",

While I wouldn't say the market is saturated, my guess would be that you would have a difficult time without something to distinguish your product (cheaper, faster, more efficient, better features, etc.). It might be worth working in the industry for a while before starting your own company. \n\n I would say the industry is growing. Our sales have increased year after year, and it looks to be only growing. \n\nThe other problem is that these are typically multi-million $/\u20ac/\u00a3 systems. Where are you going to get the capital to get started? You'll probably have to start small (1-2 machines per customer) and grow from there. \n\nCheck out [MHI](www.mhi.org)  (one of many trade organizations) as well as the websites of their members. ",

It should be server-based, accessible by 10-20 iPads and a few PCs. Does such software exist? I would appreciate any recommendations! We are a small business unit, and all equipment is stored in a compact warehouse where we work. Most available software seems tailored for large online retailers with extensive inventories, so a solution designed for small businesses would be ideal. Thank you! Adam",

        "content": "I would appreciate any suggestions for subreddits to cross-post this to! I'm looking to enhance warehouse efficiency with an idea I believe has been previously developed and likely shared online. Here\u2019s a summary of my concept: \n\n1. I have over 12,000 part numbers.\n2. We have both overstock and stock bins across 14 aisles, each containing a few items.\n3. I want a quicker way to count the bins and verify that the overstock boxes have the correct quantity marked by the manufacturer.\n4. Since one part number might come in two box types (one for stock and one for overstock), I need a program that allows me to select a part number and view different entries for weights of both stock bins and overstock boxes.\n5. I\u2019d also like to use a universal packing bin on a scale, which I can easily fill while checking counts. For smaller items, I can throw in a handful and see the quantity displayed.\n\nIn practice, I\u2019d have a laptop and USB scale with me. For example, if I want 15 units of part #123a, I would weigh the item and the packing bin if needed, then input the part number into the program, add the parts, and it would display the count, accounting for any weight variance. This would significantly speed up inventory counts by calculating quantities based on the combined weights of the items and bins.\n\nThe challenge is finding existing resources online, as most results focus on programming terms or scales for other purposes. If anyone knows of similar projects or resources, I\u2019d greatly appreciate your guidance! \n\nEDIT: The heaviest boxes will weigh 50-60 lbs, while the lightest items will be just a few ounces.",

Billions have been invested in finding the optimal ways to manage inventory/location/movement and generally barcodes (or if you're flush with cash RFID) are the way to go... (examples below are oversimple)\n\nBin location = 1number (usually consisting of row/bin) A1\nCase count = 1 part number - WCC20CB = 20countWidgetcolorblue\n\"Each\" quantity part = another part number. WIC1CB=1Widgetcolorblue\n\nIf case is unopened or visually inspected as full, scan bin, scan case barcode.\n\nIf opened, scan bin, then scan item barcodes, or count and scan item barcode and enter quantity.\n\nSo after 1 quick set of scans, you'd have you'd have Bin has X cases and X eaches of parts 1,2,3,4,5,etc.. and in many cases you don't even need to take anything out of the bins.\n\nYou can do all this with a wifi data collection terminal and dump it to the app of your choosing (heck I've seen small outfits use a Ipaq with an IR scanner $50 and MS Access).\n\nI think you'll find more programs want to work with bin/part/case/pallet where those things have weight as a unit descriptor than trying to go backwards from weight. \n\nBut if you're going to have someone \"touch\" the units anyway... scanning barcodes is going to be quicker/easier, than lugging a scale around, putting products on it, entering the product ID, putting a box on the scale, waiting for the scale weight to register, committing the weight, then putting the box back etc....   \nScan gun, scan product, put a cycle count flag in the DB and now that bin has been \"counted\" as of today's date. Never need to count it again unless something is picked/placed in it, and if you have good tracking on the bin in/out, you can go years and not count.\n\nThere's also the case where someone puts a wrong product in a box  b/c they're similar size/shape (most common mistake) so you could have products with the same/different weights in a box, again I just see this as more prone to error and the more difficult row to hoe.\n\nMy guys can usually cycle count a bin with mixed parts, with open boxes (ensuring there's no cross contamination) in a couple of minutes per bin on a good day. \n\nWith my Closed cases, it's multiple bins per minute w/out touching a box.\n",

Do they prefer to be billed on actual work done or to contract it at a fixed rate depending on their needs? What sort of special requirements do they have? Are the orders time-sensitive? Will they need to have access to software for real-time inventory? \n\nYou'd need to factor all of this together to determine what your costs will be then determine what the value of your services will be and attach that as your margin on your services. The more you can learn about their needs the more you can find ways to add value with the services that you provide. ",

Each shipment is either on a pallet or shipped loose, with costs based on the number of items and their weight. I\u2019m focusing on reducing the number of pallets used and maximizing their space. However, we often ship heavy pallets, and stacking large boxes can damage the boxes underneath, leading us to use more pallets than necessary, which is inefficient and costly. I need advice on how to distribute the weight better so that we can stack boxes without adding another pallet on top, as our supply of pallets is limited. Any tips or recommended tools/supplies would be greatly appreciated. I\u2019ve been in this role for less than a year and am eager to improve. Thank you!",

In my experience there's a sweet spot between weight and volume, as a light shipment that takes up lots of space can get quite expensive as well. One thing I've done to save some of my customers money and make their operations more expedient is consolidating LTL freight, there are many times where if you ship 3 pallets a day from X to Y you can save quite a bit of money by shipping 6 pallets every two days on a dedicated truck. Obviously this is dependent on the necessity or lack there of with expediency. Generally speaking when it comes to LTL, it does vary between carriers, as close to 3200lbs as you can get on one pallet will give you the best value. ",

We have three west coast clients who want to use our east coast warehouse to expand their operations. We have good relationships with them and want to support each other's growth. Our process is straightforward: they send us inventory, we store it, and they send us orders to fulfill via UPS or freight. We need to track incoming and outgoing inventory and orders, and we want to provide our clients access to check their inventory online. Currently, I\u2019m the only one using the software in our single warehouse location. Can anyone recommend a basic warehouse software package that would meet our needs? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

(My nephew operates a crane system for those) is amazingly different from someone who's doing distribution for big box retailers. (Which is what I mainly do)\n    \n  \n\nEven within groups of people who deal with the same types of products there's a lot of variables to consider.\n\nOf course there's also a lot of things that are common across all types of warehouses.\n  \nHeat mapping is an easy example.\nIn my case I have 300Ksqft of warehouse space with 45ft ceilings. Some of my customers are distribution customers who have lots of products that go into big box retailers which means they have a VERY high turnover. So their products get put away in \"hot zones\" that are very close to the pick/pack/ship operations. I have some B2C customers that do several orders a year, they're in a \"cold\" zone which is much farther away and/or higher up.\n  \n\nThat all ties into the workflow automation which can be done in many different ways depending on a ton of factors.\n  \n\nMy warehouse has 45ft ceilings and we stack pallets high, but amazon's robotic picking systems are low profile so it's in their best interest to buy a space that has bigger footprint with lower ceilings. (and conversely if you were designing layout/workflow to fit a pre-existing space plan, you might pick different options for how to do the work) \n  \n\nWhat if you find a great location/price on a building that has high ceilings but you don't need to stack things high,..  you can put in mezzanines and double your footprint, but now you have to deal with the fact that there's only so many points where horizontal travel are possible...\n  \n\n\"Warehouseing\" seems pretty simple at first blush, but in today's world almost no one (outside storage units) really does \"just warehousing\" there's almost always some kind of order/pick/pack/ship operation involved as well. And then places like ours are doing more and more full service (from package/product design, through the product lifecycle, all the way to handling returns and customer support) and all those things require different hooks and processes to revolve around them as well, process, physical, infrastructure, data and support.",

This can be a bucket full of parts, or a 50x50ft spot on the floor. This is where products live/are put away at/are picked from. Each bin gets a label with a bar code 1a 2a 3a etc.. (rows aisles rooms, however you want to set it up) That way when you need \"Harmon Miller chair size C color black\" the system just says \"Go to bin 1a\" you go there then it says pick \"Hmn Mllr chr blk #113001 (you scan the barcode tag and the system says \"Yup that's the right one, it's now scanned out of the bin, go ship it\" and the system reflects this accordingly.\n\nTrust me,.. if you're going to do ANY kind of volume, you absolutely want bins and products to have barcodes.\n\nwhen you start out it's a pain as you have to enter everything for the first time. \nSo you pretend you have zero inventory and do a full physical and receive everything into their locations and create the parts. While doing this you label the parts with barcodes/barcode tags (heck RFID if you're feeling froggy) and you enter all the associated data for those products in your system. Any new products coming in go through the same process (unless they're an existing part, then they just come in as an additional quantity) \n\nYou absolutely DON'T want to manage inventory operations w/out scanning things in and out. That lets the system track all the ins/outs and you can compare that to orders, run your costs (as each item should have a cost and possible a price or sell associated with it in the system) etc.. etc.. \n\nIt sounds like you don't need a megaton of bells and whistles other than that so it may be that something as simple as quickbooks and [Accivate](http://acctivate.com/) would work for you, but again w/out knowing volumes/budgets/suppport capability etc.. it's hard to say \"use this\"\n\nI work for a global warehouse/distribution/3PL company that services all the big box stores (Best Buy, Walmart etc.. etc..) as well as doing a ton of B2C stuff.

All wireless. (it winds up being plugged in while stationary and at lunch for about 3 hours a day during work time so it never starts to give a power alert, and it's got about 15min runtime once it does, so they would have plenty of time to plug it back in.  So all told about $900 and it's rock solid no \"support\" required other than plugging it in nightly.  It took me an hour to parts shop online, and less than half a day to get built, setup and ready to go. So in the end it was better all round.

You need to calculate the cube of your locations/staging area, this will give you a rough idea of much you could fit at capacity in a perfect world, then the cube of a single case of your product/sku(Divided by QTY of each case to get a cube per piece).\n\nThen you just need to find the rate of growth of your onhand inventory, you can get this by seeing how much you inbound each month vs how much you outbound.  For Example\n\n\n\nMonths | QTY Inbound | QTY Outbound | Variance\n---|---|---|----\nJan | 47 | 24 | 23\nFeb | 52 | 15 | 37\nMarch | 35 | 32 | 3\nMay | 0 | 12 | -12\nJune | 78 | 28 | 50\nJuly | 56 | 14 | 42\n\nBy taking the variance of each month and getting an average we can see that over these 6 months you actually gained 23.83 total onhand on average each month.  You can take this data as a decent indicator of how much you should expect your inventory to grow/shrink in the future.  Now more math :D.  Take the average rate of change we just found multiply by the cube of qty 1 of your sku, then take your total cube of available divided by this number and that will give you a rough idea of how many months till you reach capacity at your average inbound/outbound rate.\n\nThis of course assumes your sku is always the same size.  This can work for as many skus as you want it just gets that much more complicated the more skus you calculate for at the same time.  Also you will want to get data for as far back as you can to get a better average and you may need to make alterations based on any issues that might have arisen that could have interrupted inbound/outbound rates that would fall outside of normal circumstances.  Oh and you can replace inches with feet just as well just depends on the size of your product.\n\n\nIf you have any questions I'll be glad to elaborate I'm usually pretty bad at explaining anything to anyone XD\n\n-Stu_Brah-",

You don\u2019t want to deal with tedious paperwork or slow processes. That\u2019s why we created BYSKOM to simplify everything. \n\n**Why BYSKOM?**  \n\ud83d\udd27 **Fast & Easy Reporting:** Just take a photo of the damage, add a brief description, and submit.  \n\ud83d\udccd **GPS Tracking:** Automatically records your location, eliminating the need for manual entry.  \n\ud83d\udcac **Instant Notifications:** Receive real-time updates on your report\u2019s status.  \n\ud83d\udcca **Organized Records:** Access all your damage reports in one centralized location.  \n\ud83d\ude80 **Available On-The-Go:** Use our app anytime, whether at the loading dock or on the road.  \n\n**Who\u2019s it for?**  \n- **Owner-Operators:** Keep track of transport quality and avoid disputes.  \n- **Fleet Managers:** Simplify damage reporting for your team, cutting down on downtime and paperwork.  \n- **Anyone in the Industry:** Perfect for anyone involved with trucks, whether driving or managing!",

How do you determine that the quotes you accept are the best fit for your needs beyond just cost? 5. Are there specific tools or strategies you use to make this process more efficient?

I follow up persistently and have a backup list of vendors to ensure timely quotes.\n4. **Best Fit:** Besides cost, I evaluate quotes based on service quality, delivery times, and vendor reliability. Sometimes, a slightly higher quote is worth it for better service.\n5. **Tools/Strategies:** I use online platforms and software that aggregate quotes and provide comparison tools. Building strong relationships with reliable vendors also helps streamline the process.\n\nHope this helps, and looking forward to seeing the solution you develop!  \nBest of luck for your Business!",

I'm from Vietnam and will be starting a three-year Supply Chain Operations Management program with a co-op at George Brown College in Canada next September, which will lead to an Advanced Diploma. While I understand that practical experience is often more valuable than a degree, I have some concerns about my future career: \n\n1. Many people aim for a bachelor's degree, but I've opted for an advanced diploma in Business Administration - Supply Chain Management. I'm curious if this diploma will help me enter the industry, especially since I've heard many pursue an MBA to advance their careers.\n\n2. If I want to become a buyer or work in procurement, what entry-level jobs should I consider (like Inventory or Logistics Coordinator)? I'm currently applying for inventory positions at places like Walmart and supermarkets, but it's challenging to find opportunities. What part-time jobs could I pursue to gain relevant experience?\n\n3. The Canadian government is proposing a new policy that would limit the three-year Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) to international students in high-demand fields (STEM, Healthcare, Trades), making it harder for a Business student like me to remain in Canada post-graduation. Many countries require a bachelor's degree as a minimum for job applications, which worries me about my future prospects. Is not having a degree going to be a barrier for me?",

Another guy at my work started same time as me in his mid 30s and he\u2019s finally making 6 gigs near 40. So don\u2019t worry about how old you are, the ideal timeline is whatever works for you.\u00a0\n\nI agree with what the other guy said too. Go get an hourly warehouse job to work when you\u2019re not in class. If it\u2019s a bigger company like UPS or FedEx they\u2019ll definitely value the degree and may put you on a manager track once you\u2019re done with school. Otherwise, you still have some income while you search. Not to mention if the company is big enough you could ask for a transfer to the location you\u2019d like to job search in.\u00a0\n\nAnd don\u2019t give a thought to chicks right now, dating after you have a career is as different to college dating as college is to highschool dating.

Ask your friends/people for help - no friends? Seek out a local meetup that aligns with your passion.\n3. Put yourself out there - in person and in social\n4. Expand your mind to recognize those coming in contact with your life - if there\u2019s something intriguing ask and ask if they\u2019re willing to help you \n5. List yourself on all hiring platforms  - take whatever decent job you can, make friends with the right superiors, and apply yourself + do good honest work\n6. Leverage AI / employment companies to create bomb resumes and help get you out there\n7. Dating apps - sign up for all but ideally friends of friends. \n8. Network actively and ask great questions \n9. Meditate, read, and know all of this will pass\n10. You\u2019re young, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the beauty and challenge of life. \n12. Seek professional help too if you need it. Therapy helps all people and there are wellness organizations that can possibly help you free or at minimum cost. There should be tons of wellness non profits (I\u2019ve not used them but assuming this is the case, until you can pay for a service or therapist on your own.)\n\nNavigate it as best you can, talk to people, be open about your struggles, find your communities, do good work, help people out even if it doesn\u2019t benefit you, and that lucky break will happen.\n\nOpportunities to advance and get to where you want to be in life is a function of manufactured luck - maximize your chances for getting lucky and eventually you will. It won\u2019t be easy to start but eventually it will become habit and the right mindset will help you overcome. \n\nWishing you clear waters and smooth sailing, change your course if you need, but ride it out my friend.

Consider certifications in relevant areas.\n\nApply smart: focus on entry-level positions and attend career fairs. Use your college's career services for help with your resume and job search.\n\nHighlight skills: emphasize relevant coursework, projects, and transferable skills like communication and problem-solving.\n\nStay positive and keep applying.

The reason is that this would be appealing criteria, you can do it on the side, and it can be applied nearly universally at a job (probably much needed anyway). It's basically what a decade ago used to be 'website & social media experience' type of thing.",

Traditional approaches often depend on detailed reports, meetings, and written communication for information sharing and progress tracking. While effective in some situations, these methods can hinder timely decision-making and responsiveness. In contrast, visual management systems transform team operations by utilizing visual elements like charts, graphs, and color-coded displays, making information easily accessible and understandable. This promotes faster decision-making and increases workforce engagement. Key Differences: Communication: Traditional methods depend on written reports and meetings, whereas visual systems use visual cues for quick understanding. Accessibility: Visual management systems facilitate easier data access, saving time on document searches. Decision-making: Visual cues allow for quicker decisions by presenting information clearly. Engagement: Visual systems boost employee engagement by making goals and progress visible to all. Adaptability: Traditional methods may be less agile in responding to changes compared to visual management systems.",

It allows companies to systematically identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential risks. Key components include: 1. Visual mapping of the supply chain 2. Risk identification, such as political instability and environmental issues 3. Improved anticipation and management of disruptions. The process generally involves: 1. Thorough data collection on supply chain elements 2. Risk prioritization based on likelihood and impact 3. Consideration of unpredictable events like natural disasters 4. Regular audits and inspections. This method can also enhance sustainability and operational efficiency. To keep risk maps effective, companies use tools like ESG dashboards, supplier audits, and employee feedback programs. In a time of increasing supply chain complexity and global challenges, Supply Chain Risk Mapping is essential for maintaining competitiveness and resilience, helping to mitigate disruptions while fostering continuous improvement across the supply network.

Without it you\u2019re likely looking at working in a warehouse, truck terminal, truck driver, railroad conductor, ramp operator at cargo airfield.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a jerk, but let\u2019s be honest your four years in the Marines are a great experience, but frankly most companies don\u2019t really care\u2026 seriously.  Some industries like the Railroads, seaport longshoremen and trucking do\u2026 if you\u2019re looking at that.  But most companies after they thank you for your service won\u2019t care much.\n\nAlso be cognizant of where you want to live and work.  Major hubs like Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles Seattle, even Jacksonville have a ton of Logistics positions.  If you\u2019re looking to go to Rapid City SD or   Columbia SC\u2026 places like that not so much.\n\nLast of you\u2019re thinking Trucking or Railroads or Merchant Marines or similar\u2026 kids your wife and kids and college aspirations good bye, you\u2019ll never see them.\n\n(Source: Recently retired Army Logistics\u202620+ years)",

During my final year of high school, I didn't take pure mathematics, accounting, or economics; I only studied business studies and mathematical literacy. At that time, I wasn't sure about my career path, and my subject choices lacked focus. Now, I've developed a strong interest in logistics and achieved a bachelor's pass in my matric, though my marks weren't outstanding and I didn't earn any distinctions. I've researched various logistics paths in terms of education and careers, and I want to know if I need extensive knowledge of accounting and pure math to pursue logistics, or if it varies by specific careers. My goal is to work in warehouse management, starting as a general warehouse worker (like a packer or driver) while I study. I'm also working on my Excel and basic bookkeeping skills through online courses, as I'm interested in office administration and know these skills will help me. I haven't been in school for a while because I've been a full-time mom and I'm currently homeschooling my children, but I plan to enroll them in public school so I can work and study. I'm feeling quite intimidated about returning to school. Do you have any advice for someone without a background in accounting and pure math who wants to pursue logistics? Should I reconsider my plans? Thank you!",

I also use Vessel Finder and Carrier Reports to estimate the workload for our warehouse of about 200-300 people, allowing us to prepare in advance and adjust hours as needed.

Our main goal is to ensure all products are received correctly and in the condition claimed by the vendor, while also paying the P.O.s.\n\nWhat should I pursue next? Before registering for classes, my uncle suggested that Supply Chain is essentially an advanced version of Logistics, offering broader opportunities and more growth potential. How significant is the difference between SCM and Logistics? Would a career in Logistics limit me to warehouse positions? If so, how can I advance in Logistics?

Any insights would be appreciated! Additionally, which industry accreditation is preferred: CIPS, CPSM, or CSCP? Thank you!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, before sharing my thoughts on a warehousing career, I want to mention that I hold a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a major in international business and am currently pursuing a master's degree in supply chain management. After graduating in 2020, I began working as a warehouse administrator at DB Schenker, where I managed customer interactions and tracked orders using SAP. Unfortunately, the work environment was toxic, and employees, including management, were often looked down upon. My experience was challenging, as I had to commute two hours each way six days a week without transportation or allowances. \n\nI eventually left that job and sought opportunities in logistics and supply chain. Then, I received a call from DHL via LinkedIn, interviewed with the regional manager, and got hired. DHL is a much better experience; they provide allowances, a salary increase, and transportation. However, I still prefer to work in logistics or supply chain rather than warehousing. I feel stuck in my current position with no clear path for advancement, and I'm unsure whether to continue in warehousing as a stepping stone toward a logistics role at headquarters after completing my master's. I would appreciate any advice or support, as I'm feeling lost. Thank you.",

        "content": "I'm currently interning at a mid-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on their Warehouse Management System (WMS). While I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS could improve our disorganized warehouse, where items frequently go missing and finding anything is challenging. We're still using outdated methods without an effective system. We have two warehouse employees and storage for around 1,900 pallets. My proposal includes implementing barcode labeling and scanners to enhance inventory control and organizing the warehouse by SKU. I believe a WMS could help with managing SKUs and barcoding.\n\nTo optimize the warehouse for the future, we need better tracking of goods and procurement, as many old items linger due to a lack of oversight. I aim to improve insights on inventory locations for more efficient order picking, streamline the receiving process, and automate operations. Currently, only two suppliers provide compatible barcodes, complicating inventory accuracy. \n\nThere are challenges with WMS integration, particularly concerning our Exact Globe + ERP system, which may cause issues. Implementation costs are estimated between thousands to over 10,000 euros, raising the question of whether it's necessary. One vendor suggested using CVC files and an FTP server, but I lack expertise in that area. A standalone system might be a better option, but WMS is crucial for inventory accuracy and doesn\u2019t align with our current processes. \n\nWe manually write off used goods during manufacturing, leading to many discrepancies since the warehouse is open for anyone to take what they need. While we don't need all WMS features, we seek better control over our inventory and procurement data. I'm uncertain about the quality of supplier barcodes and whether this can be resolved with scanners and printers, as we only have one scanner that works with two suppliers.\n\nI want a WMS solution but am concerned about potential issues with our ERP and existing processes, which could significantly increase costs. With fewer than 100 employees, our budget is limited, and one vendor quoted over 40,000 euros plus 2,000 euros annually, which seems excessive. I would appreciate guidance, as navigating this situation feels overwhelming.",

                "content": "From what you've described, it sounds like your company could really benefit from implementing a robust (yet affordable) WMS. Let me explain why ...\n\nA WMS is essentially a software solution designed to help companies manage their warehouse operations more efficiently. It provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, tracks the movement of goods, and optimizes warehouse processes.\n\nIn your case, where stuff seems to go missing frequently and it's challenging to locate items, a WMS can be a game-changer. With a WMS in place, you'll have a centralized system that keeps track of every item in your warehouse. This means no more searching high and low for missing products!\n\nOne potential WMS solution that might\u00a0be worth looking into is Zenventory. Zenventory is an intuitive, easy-to-use, out-of-the-box (and affordable) WMS software that offers a range of features to streamline warehouse operations. It can help automate tasks like receiving, put-away, picking, and shipping, saving employees precious time and minimizing errors. (The software also supports barcode scanning and barcode creation.) \n\nFull disclaimer: I do work at Zenventory. So, I am a little biased. But there are many other WMS options out there - a quick Google search will show you just that. :)\u00a0  \n  \nGood luck finding the best solution for you and your business!\u00a0\u00a0",

My first question is what literature can I read to better understand operations management and shipping dynamics? Who should I connect with in the industry to ensure smoother operations for both sea and air freight? Additionally, since ethics and morals can vary, which professionals might I consider giving kickbacks to (as it's seen as a business expense here), and how would that help lower my operational costs?",

The company aims for a target of 700KGs/LDM, but while some lines meet this goal, others consistently fall short due to various potential issues, such as unreliable customer data, loading and unloading times, and inefficient planning. \n\nMy research objective is to identify the factors leading to these low LDM rates and propose improvement strategies. I plan to employ a mixed-methods approach for data collection, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods.\n\n**Quantitative Data Collection:** I will observe the loading processes for selected export lines over a month, recording key metrics like loading times, planned versus actual LDM, and utilization rates using standardized forms.\n\n**Qualitative Data Collection:** After each week of observations, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with warehouse staff and coordinators involved in the export lines to gather insights on inconsistencies, challenges affecting LDM efficiency, and suggestions for improvements.\n\n**Data Analysis:** I aim to integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings to understand how different factors interact and influence LDM.\n\nI'm seeking feedback on my research methodology\u2014are there any weaknesses or areas for improvement? Additionally, are there any theories or frameworks on logistics optimization or warehouse efficiency, aside from the Theory of Constraints, that you would recommend? Thank you!",

        "content": "Hello everyone. I feel a bit overwhelmed, but I've secured a well-paying position as a supply chain analyst at a manufacturing company, which is a significant step up from my previous role as a data entry clerk. While I appreciate my current job, the manual processes are exhausting. The company, though growing quickly, relies heavily on Excel for everything, which is challenging for me to manage. \n\nMy daily routine involves processing purchase orders (POs) sent via EDI, which are then faxed to me\u2014yes, faxed! I organize these POs by customer and ship date, logging each one into an Excel sheet manually. After booking each PO with the customer, I have to log it again on another sheet for carrier pickup. I\u2019ve created some automated templates in Excel to help streamline this, but it's still very time-consuming.\n\nI also monitor line efficiency and inventory using Excel, generating reports for head office that summarize our plant\u2019s performance. If we run out of materials, that falls on me, but I often struggle to keep track of inventory due to my workload. I dictate daily production based on customer orders and need to anticipate demand, but the current manual tracking system is insufficient.\n\nMy personal life has been quite hectic, and I worry that dedicating time to improving our processes will delay order fulfillment. Fortunately, another person has been hired to assist with manual entry, allowing me to focus on inventory and efficiency. I\u2019m eager to tackle these challenges but unsure where to begin.",

        "content": "I attend a well-known, top-ranked supply chain management university in the northeastern U.S., but it's a satellite campus. I've observed that most students in supply chain programs who secure prestigious internships and high-level jobs after graduation are primarily white. At a recent event by Heinz Kraft, a leading consumer packaged goods company, all employees were from elite schools like Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, with no representation from lesser-known state universities. This raises an important question: Do graduates from less recognized state schools have a real opportunity to land high-paying internships, which could lead to job offers starting between $80,000 and $100,000, potentially with companies covering their master\u2019s or MBA expenses, and eventually earning $250,000 to $350,000 annually? I'm curious if this is a feasible path for students from less prestigious state schools.",

Search an American distributor as the Consignee to see where they are buying goods from internationally. Then search some of those international suppliers as the Shipper to see which other American distributors they are supplying to. This is a great way to find wholesale distributors in the US and to find overseas manufacturers for private label. \n\nThey only give you a few free searches per day. When those free searches are exhausted, you can simply change the location in your VPN to get another few free searches. Rinse and repeat.\n\nFor more Amazon FBA gems, check out The Curated Clutch: [https://www.thecuratedclutch.com/tag/amazon-fba/](https://www.thecuratedclutch.com/tag/amazon-fba/)",

Do you find them useful, or do you think they're unnecessary? Personally, I find them somewhat helpful for an overview, but I still need to reach out to operators for precise lead times and costs. They save me a little time, but not significantly. The interface is appealing, though it seems to have limited route options. There's a vast schedule network, including inland barge and rail options, and the map is impressive. However, the quote system is ineffective. It's beneficial to have price estimates and capacity information.",

Can I rely solely on Quizlet or Pocket Prep without the CSCP Learning System? (I have some materials from my master's program, but I'm unsure if that's enough.)\n2. Which third-party learning system would you recommend: Quizlet, Pocket Prep, Data Chem, or others? \n\nAbout the CSCMP SCPro Certificate: \n3. Has anyone achieved this certificate? Can you share your exam experience, its difficulty, and any helpful resources or tips? \n4. For those with both CSCP and CSCMP certificates, did you notice overlapping content or questions? Do you believe that obtaining the CSCP certificate would adequately prepare me for the CSCMP exam without additional study materials? Thank you!",

To give you some background, I started in warehousing after earning my bachelor's in Supply Chain Management (Operations emphasis) but soon realized it wasn't the right fit. I worked there for three years while pursuing a master's in Integrated Supply Chain Management during the COVID pandemic, which hindered my plans to transition to the corporate side of my company. I eventually left for a role at a company supplying medical products to hospitals, starting as an associate supply planner at about $60,000. I loved this job, and after eight months, I completed my master's degree, intending to leverage it for a raise. I worked hard for a promotion and, upon my one-year anniversary, accepted a new position as a supply planner. Unfortunately, I could only negotiate my salary to $68,000, which felt disappointing, but I later received a raise to $75,000 after a market review. I've excelled in my role and have been told I'm ready for the next step, but senior positions in planning are scarce. I recently interviewed for a supply chain management role but lost out to a senior buyer with over nine years of experience. \n\nMy question for more experienced individuals is: how can I break into a six-figure salary? While I don't want to seem solely focused on money, it is crucial for me as I need to support my wife, who was laid off while pregnant, and our 10-month-old daughter. I'm exploring opportunities in tech and would appreciate insights on other options. I have extensive knowledge of AS400 and SAP, so any related opportunities would be great. If you have advice and would like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. Thank you!",

Unfortunately, most companies won't let you continue to grow several steps up, and even when they do the pay increase is typically between 7% and 12% per promotion. It's dumb, but it's one of those corporate BS unwritten rules.\n\nYou will be able to grow salary leaps and bounds moving around. 3 years at a company is perfectly acceptable nowadays and you won't look like a job hopper with that as an average.\n\nMy biggest additional advice would be to consider jobs in other cities/states. Your child is young enough that you won't be uprooting them from familiar school/friends, and your wife isn't currently employed. Opening your target job market so multiple states also multiplies your possibility for large salary increases. With your years experience, you should be able to negotiate a relocation bonus which would cover the cost of the move. Depending on the area, distance, and CoL, I would aim for about $12k.",

Usually companies will be less strict about entry level education and GPA when you\u2019ve worked for them for awhile, For example working at a Walmart store and then getting promoted/transferring to their corporate office in bentonville, or working at a target store and then promoted/transferring to the Minneapolis corporate office once you graduate.

Right now, I use separate Excel spreadsheets for each supplier (see attached image). These contain shipping details from the supplier or freight forwarder, and I can track container numbers and vessels. However, I struggle to determine which items from the purchase orders are in each container, especially when dealing with lengthy orders spread across multiple containers. While I can handle the spreadsheets, they consume a lot of my time, and the process feels unnecessarily tedious. Additionally, the shared document feature in Excel is ineffective, leading my colleagues to maintain their own spreadsheets. Communication via email is also cumbersome; I've set up subfolders to organize messages, but I've still missed crucial information. We frequently handle international shipments with long lead times, and I once forgot to send a purchase order, which upset several people. I'm relatively new to supply chain management, and my boss, who taught me the current processes, is open to trying a new system. I\u2019d appreciate any suggestions on improving my workflow or recommendations for systems that could help address these challenges.",

I'm seeking insights from those in small and medium-sized businesses, especially where advanced technology for automating KPI calculations and reporting may be lacking or underutilized. For smaller companies, how much time do you typically spend on manual KPI calculations and reporting? What tools or methods do you use? Additionally, if you're involved in creating reports or presentations for leadership, how long does it take you to draft an email or create a PowerPoint? For those in medium-sized companies with established tech stacks, how effectively can you analyze your KPIs, dashboards, or reports using your current technology? Does your tech stack significantly decrease the time and effort required compared to manual processes? I'm interested in understanding the workload of KPI management in smaller companies and whether larger companies benefit from efficiencies in automating these tasks. I look forward to your thoughts.",

After a brief transit, I indicated I would file a claim when signing the Bill of Lading and later presented evidence of the damage to the senior manager, who advised me to assess the extent of the damage before contacting him again. The damage occurred because a local facility manager neglected the shipment for over two months, exposing it to poor conditions that caused mold and permanent harm. \n\nI'm trying to approach the senior manager appropriately, as this is a small company and my claim's outcome depends on his willingness to proceed. However, he has been trying to dismiss my concerns and claims there's no liability, despite having received detailed evidence of the damage. I plan to present evidence of the delays caused by the facility manager\u2019s negligence and assert their liability for improper storage. I want to negotiate an amicable settlement for the items that are irreparably damaged, particularly some valuable collector's books. \n\nI'm looking for advice on how to be assertive yet polite, maintain a good relationship with the manager, and indicate that I\u2019m willing to escalate the issue if necessary. I have several months left to resolve this since the claim limit is one year, and while I prefer not to hire a lawyer, I\u2019m prepared to be persistent in dealing with this manager.",

I'm 30 years old (turning 31 when I start) and currently work in inventory control for a chemical company's supply chain, earning $64,000 in Arizona. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in business communication and have been pursuing a career in supply chain, which I find fascinating. I previously worked in transportation management and as a planner for a government warehouse. Should I pursue my MBA? I've heard my new company offers $5,000 per year for tuition reimbursement if I achieve at least a B in my classes, but I haven\u2019t confirmed this yet. I plan to stay long-term at my current job and evaluate my situation in a couple of years. I've had to change jobs twice recently, and my regular business degree lacks a supply chain focus. Would an MBA with a concentration in supply chain be worthwhile? The program costs $60,000, and the company might reimburse $10,000 to $15,000 over 2-3 years. However, extending to three years just for an additional $5,000 seems excessive. I've heard having an MBA could lead to better long-term earnings. After reimbursement, I'd be looking at $29,000 in undergrad debt plus an additional $45,000 to $50,000 for the MBA, depending on the company's support. I intend to apply for scholarships, but my GPA is 2.54, so I'm uncertain about my chances. Being from Mexico, I've faced challenges that contributed to my GPA, but I have strong aspirations to improve Arizona, which motivates my desire for an MBA. I feel I have a compelling story and purpose, but I seek professional advice before taking on more debt for school, as I want to ensure it will be beneficial in the end. What are your thoughts? Thank you!",

The Panama Canal is undergoing a major drought, halving vessel transit in January compared to October. Meanwhile, carriers are steering clear of the Suez Canal due to risks of missile attacks and hijackings by Houthi rebels. This will significantly disrupt global trade, requiring ships to go around the Cape of Good Hope and utilize alternative land routes. To complicate the situation, demand is rising ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays. Be aware and ready for possible delays and higher costs.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm developing a demand forecasting tool that incorporates external events like new laws and consumer sentiment to analyze their impact on demand using machine learning algorithms. I'm interested in learning about the experiences of buyers and demand planners in the food, pharma, and building materials sectors regarding their planning and purchasing processes, and whether this tool could be beneficial. Having grown up in the import/export food industry, I'm aware that purchasing often relies on intuition\u2014such as competitor pricing, supply chain issues, and environmental factors affecting supply. Would a tool that highlights macroeconomic trends affecting product demand be useful to you? For example: - Demand for Product A is projected to drop by 20% next week due to an upcoming tariff in XYZ countries. - Demand for Product B is expected to rise by 4% next month due to increased grain commodity prices. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

I spoke with an advisor at a local community college and found out I only need two more credits in a foreign language to earn an associate degree in arts, which would allow me to transfer directly into a bachelor\u2019s program focused on business with a supply chain concentration. The program offers three specializations: 1) procurement, 2) project management, and 3) supply chain analytics. I\u2019m looking for a career with opportunities for advancement and the possibility of starting my own business someday. Which specialization would you recommend and why? Any relevant information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

Previously, I ran a cloud kitchen startup in India for two years, but had to close it due to the second COVID-19 lockdown. I have a postgraduate diploma in supply chain management and business analytics from Canada, and I completed an MBA in marketing and human resource management from 2017 to 2019 while running my startup. With only two years left on my work permit, I'm considering getting an AZ truck driving license in Ontario. Although the $10,000 investment and one-month training seem daunting, I see it as a way into the transportation sector, hoping to transition into logistics later. However, I'm concerned because my true passion is in procurement, and I'm afraid I might end up stuck in a driving role due to the high demand for truck drivers. I would appreciate any advice on this situation, and I'm also interested in the challenges of moving from logistics to procurement. Thank you.",

What would be extremely helpful is:\n\n1. The tools required for analytics. This includes being VERY adept at Excel (sadly this is still used at nearly every company) - to the level of VBA/macros. Learn SQL. Learn some sort of visualization software (PowerBI and/or Tableau). If you are into programming, learn Python and/or (or Octave if you are good at calculus and linear algebra). All of these will give you an edge on getting a job over someone with a SC degree but without valuable skills.\n\n2. Consider getting either a Master's Certificate in supply chain management or becoming APICS certified. I don't know what the APICS cost is, but Master's Certificate can go from about $4k to $12k in the US, depending on the school. This will show that you have some solid conceptual understanding of supply chains despite a poli sci (or spanish lit) undergrad.\n\n3. Consider working at a distribution center as a coordinator. Pay isn't always great and it will be a good amount of assistant-type work, but you will be exposed to the environment and able to learn the ropes. This is valuable experience to get you into a more admin role in other pillars of supply chain.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Now, I'm considering whether to use this time to pursue a master's degree in supply chain management. Before making that decision, I want to understand the field better. Are there common risks I should be aware of and prepare for if I work in this role? Can tasks become overly stressful depending on the company?

And all of them passed certification after 5+ years of career. Despite all of them were very good in terms of supply chain knowledge,  I would personally not recommend to do it before you try different fields of supply chain. I am pretty sure, that if you would fall in love with manufacturing or procurement fields - other certification will be more helpful. Plus, with experience, the knowledge you will get will land better.   \nI am thinking of passing CPIM myself, but because I want to change region of my current work and go in more senior level.",

This includes storing raw materials, transforming them into finished products, and transporting them to consumers. The primary aim of SCM is to align supply with demand through effective logistics, making it essential for a company's success. A career in this vital department can be lucrative, and even if companies outsource SCM tasks, it creates more job opportunities in the field. To advance in SCM, pursuing an MBA in Supply Chain Management is recommended. \n\n1. **What is an MBA in Supply Chain Management?** \nAn MBA in Supply Chain Management is a two-year postgraduate program that provides a strategic understanding of SCM processes, including logistics and project management, while also developing essential business skills like communication and problem-solving. Key subjects include Management Principles, Logistics Management, Quality Techniques, Retail Marketing, and Strategic Management.\n\n2. **Why pursue this course?**\nInvestment in India's supply chain sector has surged recently, with significant funding examples like Future Supply Solutions raising nearly Rs.130 billion, indicating a growing industry with abundant, well-paying opportunities.\n\n3. **What are the career prospects?**\nGraduates can pursue various high-paying roles such as Procurement Analyst, Logistics Manager, and Supply Chain Manager, with starting salaries ranging from Rs 6 to 9 lacs per annum, which can increase significantly with experience. \n\nIf you believe this course suits you, consider enrolling in a top MBA college in Pune, which offers excellent faculty and strong placement support.",

        "content": "I'm developing a system for a chemical manufacturer to monitor inventory from raw material receipt through blending and into finished product holding tanks. The finished product is dispatched daily in tankers. In case of quality issues, they need to trace back to identify all raw materials used. Currently, this process relies on spreadsheets and the production team's memory. We've successfully implemented barcode generation and scanning for raw materials. However, we've encountered a problem: the finished product doesn't go into a single quarantined holding tank as initially stated, but rather into any available tank without established procedures. This complicates tracking the raw materials used, as there's no way to know when a batch has been depleted from the tanks. I suggest quarantining a single tank until it's full and assigning a production code to it, while using other tanks for orders. Once it's filled, the next empty tank can be quarantined, allowing for orderly dispatch of the product. Is this a good recommendation? I'm seeking insights from others involved in chemical production and raw material inventory management.",

This will help me give a better answer.\n\nAnyway, as an inventory planning manager, I would recommend a software which has inbuilt reordering workflows like - \n\n1. Should have a summary table that highlights the skus which are going to out of stock in the coming 15 days or 30 days, depending on your lead time for sourcing.   \n   Once you click on that, it should open up those skus. It should have all the relevant metrics like average sale (adjusted for out of stock days), current inventory, intransit inventory and how much to reorder. It should also consider how the product was performing in the same season, last year.\n\n2. No software is perfect. So, it should give you an option to modify the reorder quantity so that you can use your personal business intelligence. \n\n3. Currently, you are waiting for a week to sync your data. Your approach is reactive rather than proactive.  \nThe software should sync the data everyday so that you are always on top of what is going on. \n\n4. The software should have dashboards to highlight the products where you have excess inventory. It should also highlight whether the reason for this excess inventory is excess ordering in the past or minimum order quantity or sales drop. This will help you take actions on these skus and will also present you from excess ordering in the future, if its because of manual error.\n\n  \n5. The software should have an option to raise the Purchase orders and it should automatically sync when the goods are received at your warehouse against this purchase orders.   \n   This will help you stay on top of delayed deliveries. This will also help you with vendor performance metrics interms of lead time and fill rate.",

Is there an existing app that connects to Excel, or any free software that can fulfill these needs? I'm also open to suggestions, such as using MySQL instead of Excel if that's simpler. Thank you!",

A purchases module (supplier info, item breakdown, costs, dates, etc.) with barcode printing. 2. A sales module (customer info, item breakdown, costs, dates, etc.). 3. A reports module (inventory aging, sales reports, profit/loss, etc.). 4. A CRM module (tracking wholesale/retail customers). I understand there may be programs with some of these features, but I'm hoping to find one that has most of them already developed. Thank you!",

        "content": "I'm currently interning at a medium-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on the Warehouse Management System (WMS). Although I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS can assist us. Our warehouse is disorganized; items frequently go missing, and we lack a proper system. We have two warehouse employees and can store about 1,900 pallets. I believe implementing barcode labeling and scanners could improve inventory control and organization by structuring the warehouse by SKUs. I seek software for managing these SKUs and barcoding. \n\nTo enhance operations, we need better insights into goods' locations for efficient order picking and putaway, as well as data on time spent and inventory for procurement optimization. Currently, many old items linger in the warehouse due to a lack of overview and an outdated receiving process. Only two suppliers provide barcodes compatible with our scanner. \n\nHowever, I face challenges with WMS integration; vendors are uncertain about compatibility, especially with our ERP system, Exact Globe +, which has potential issues. Implementation costs are estimated at thousands of euros, and I'm unsure if it's necessary or if a standalone solution might be better. Our current process involves writing off used goods during manufacturing, which leads to inventory discrepancies, but it seems reliable.\n\nWe don't need all WMS features, just better control over our inventory and procurement data. I'm also uncertain about the quality of supplier barcodes\u2014can this be resolved with barcode printers and scanners? With only one compatible scanner, I\u2019m concerned about recommending a WMS due to potential ERP issues and high costs, especially since our company has fewer than 100 employees and a limited budget. One vendor quoted over \u20ac40,000 plus annual costs, which seems excessive. I would appreciate any guidance, as this situation feels overwhelming.",

The resources that need planning are machines, manpower and materials. The software you have is not covering any of these three.   So effectively the company is being run manually.

It is just reading numbers in a bar-font format.\n\nThe video link below is for a small business, and will give you some ideas for 1+2. It probably would not be adequate for the final WMS, but it would get you in control of inventory, and the data could be imported into a WMS later. \n\nThe video also shows how barcodes can be generated and tracked. The barcode can be designed to state which rack and isle the items are in, along with a SKU code. \n\n[https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/](https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/)\n\nNow you have a basic system in place to manage supplies. \n\n3.

I really think you could do that with any item, look at the past 6 months and make educated guesses going forward.",

Currently, we track our toolboxes using a Cognito form I created, but it's inconvenient and not user-friendly, requiring a new inventory each time instead of easy edits. \n\nI need a system to list all our toolboxes (over 100 at this site) and the tools each should contain. The Tool Coordinator will inventory a box and update it using an accessible method (ideally an app). It would also be great if the app could assign boxes to technicians, but if not, we can use an Excel sheet. \n\nMy manager wants a four-layer audit for ISO compliance, where the technician can log into the app to self-inventory their box periodically. They can request replacements for lost or broken tools or mark them as nonexistent, which would alert the coordinator. Additionally, the tool coordinator will conduct regular inspections, and there will be a final inventory check with both the technician and coordinator to ensure completeness, holding the technician accountable for any discrepancies.\n\nIs there a program that exists for this purpose? Thank you!",

Since you\u2019re a small business I would recommend going with a software geared toward small to medium sized businesses, as they tend to be more affordable.

I personally use inFlow because of how easy it was to pick up. The UI is very intuitive and modern. Something you\u2019ll find with a lot of inventory management systems is they look like they\u2019re from the 90s.\n\nWith inFlow you can put pictures in your product descriptions and use units of measure. They also have an incredible built in barcoding system. \n\nWhatever you do make sure to do your due diligence and give a couple options a go. Many have free trials (inFlow has a 14 day free trial). Also contact the sales department for whichever software you\u2019re looking at and tell them your workflow. They will be able to tell you for sure whether or not the software can do what you need it to.",

Workers usually won't do this update step when they are moving things around and your inventory tracking will go out of sync (this is what we have seen in such scenarios.. no SOP helps).  So, when a customer comes and asks for a 20x4x3 plank, you would know you have it in stock (because of your inventory software), but would need to search the lot to find where is it placed!  This, in my opinion, would be your real problem (no SOP). \n\nIf you don't have an issue of locating the part / wood int he storage area and only concerned about easily searching and marking the item as \"sold\" (based on the ref number) in the system, then it's a straight forward thing (i.e., is not your real problem).  Any software or Excel sheet can be used for doing the inventory sales tracking. The benefit you get is, you will know what you have in stock (assuming, new entries are made when you stock up and you update the sale correctly each time, on time) and can pull up reports as you desire.\n\nPlease correct me here if I am wrong.",

For e.g if you receive, a log of wood that undergoes, cutting, polishing and finishing to become plywood, then you need either an ERP or a WMS system that has the work order functionality. You can again consider something like Zoho, Hopstack, Netsuite etc but all these functionalities typically cost upwards of $20k annually.",

For example, Product A originally had PARs of 94 max and 50 min, which I changed to 70 and 40. The unit cost for Product A is $918.67. I aim to show a total savings of $31,234.78 by calculating the reductions from both minimum and maximum PARs (34 units). However, my colleague argues that I can only report the maximum PAR savings, totaling $22,048.08 from a 24-unit reduction. Any insights would be helpful!",

We would like to scan the barcodes on pet food bags and supplies to automatically populate a spreadsheet with details such as amount donated, brand, type of food, weight, and Fair Market value. For example: 1 bag of PEDIGREE Adult Dog Dry Food (Grilled steak and vegetable flavors), 44 lbs, $29.98; 1 Fresh Step Multi-Cat Scented Litter, 25 lbs, $17.59. Since we rely entirely on donations, it's crucial for us to maintain an accurate count of incoming supplies, as we can't afford to order or purchase items. Thank you!",

        "content": "I've been in business for five years and recently received a form from the city regarding Personal Property Tax. They now ask how I calculate my year-end inventory\u2014FIFO, LIFO, COST, RETAIL, or OTHER. Previously, the form only required my monthly purchases and a copy of my Schedule C. As a thrift store, I pay cash for items, often using a tiered payment system: 30% for low-end clothing brands, 40% for high-end, and 50% for toys and baby gear. When I receive large quantities of clothing, the price I pay per item decreases with the number of items. It's impractical to track the purchase price of each individual item since I have over 18,000 items in my store. I keep track of my total monthly expenditures for budgeting but can't specify what I paid for each item. I periodically walk the store to clear out unsold items, and I often have 20-30 totes waiting to be processed. When I discussed my inventory challenges with my accountant, they suggested estimating that about 12-15% of my inventory remains unsold at year-end. For instance, if I spent $25,650 on merchandise, I would report around $3,078 as leftover inventory. I can count my items but can't determine the exact purchase price for each one. Can anyone help me understand this issue better? I feel overwhelmed.",

I've considered Asset Tiger and liked its layout, but it doesn't support quantity tracking, which is a dealbreaker. Additionally, I'm looking for software without a subscription model. I'm open to paying for a quality program since we have a solid budget. Please share any recommendations you may have. I've also looked at Fishbowl and Asset Panda, but both require subscriptions.

A worker loads the materials and puts the ticket into a bin. 5. At the end of the day, the manager manually enters the ticket into the inventory system, which is time-consuming and outdated. This method causes delays in tracking inventory, increases the likelihood of errors, and results in lost tickets due to disorganization. Customers often get confused because our inventory system may show items as available when they're not.

We want to assign a unique serial number to each part to track details such as who soldered, tested it, its performance, and any issues. These parts will then be assembled into a unit. Ideally, when I select a unit in the software, it would expand to display all sub-components, along with a \"Location\" field to indicate where each unit is located. We don't require features like invoice tracking, PO processing, or shipping labels; we simply need to monitor each component and its assembly into a unit. Currently, we use EZOfficeInventory for tracking but are finding it insufficient. I tried Zoho, but it seems overly complex for our needs. I considered using Excel, but it likely won't suffice for organizing multiple parts into units at different locations. I would appreciate any advice on suitable solutions or guidance. Thank you!",

I can imagine the hardest part to your use-case is assigning an individual cost to each part that comes off a machine. In some ways maybe its just easier to assign cost by weight. if a machine is 500lbs and you pay $500 and a carburetor weights 20lbs then its costs $20.\n\na good starting point might be to look for inventory softwares with \"disassembly feature\" or \"coproducts/byproducts\" features.",

                "content": "Definitely have seen these projects before - props to you for taking it on! If it were me I'd start with the following:\n\n1. If your company has a list of part numbers and BoMs pull those. Determine with your team which part numbers are valid - i.e. which are old revisions that the company doesn't care about, and which are current. This will help later when determining what to do with old inventory you'll find when you cycle count. You'll probably get a bunch of \"idks\" for if a part number matters, that's fine just notate it.\n2. Work with your accounting team and engineers to make sure there is a checkout process from inventory that will be followed. There's no point doing a full cycle count without a process that everyone in the company agrees to follow to maintain the inventory count. This may also have implications for your ERP/Inventory system (if you have one). This will probably take a while to nail down.\n3. You'll need to do a full cycle count. If you think you can count all of your inventory over 2 days (this depends on your team size and inventory size) then I'd recommend closing the inventory over a weekend and going through shelf by shelf with your team and any volunteers. It'll be important to notate - part number, location, quantity, unit of measure for everything you find. I'd keep these counts in a separate Excel, not in a system\n   1. If you can't do all the counting over a weekend, break it up into sections you can do over a weekend (so you don't have to close down the inventory for the week). Once a section is complete, that section **must** follow the agreed upon inventory check out process from step 2, otherwise the work will be for nothing.\n4. Once you have a process in place, and the existing quantities for your parts, work with your accounting team to determine what parts should be brought back into inventory. Use what you found in step 1, i.e. which parts matter, and which don't, to determine which part quantities you care about\n5. Your accounting team should be able to help you correctly determine the accounting entries that are needed after you present the parts and quantities the company cares about, and which they no longer need. This will be the inventory adjustment that will likely lead to your accounting team doing a write off.  \n\n\nHope that makes sense! Happy to go into any additional detail as needed. Note if you're using Quickbooks to track inventory quantities, you really should get another system. Something like [Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlinventory.com/), [Redshift](https://redshift-app.com/), or [Katana](https://katanamrp.com/). Unless you need a full ERP - which begins a second discussion :D",

We\u2019ve been exploring IMS solutions since we currently track inventory bi-weekly using a basic spreadsheet. We\u2019ve identified FishBowl and Katana as two strong contenders for our needs. Presently, we use HubSpot CRM for client interactions, and when a deal is marked \"Closed Won,\" we transfer that data to Smartsheet via Make (API). We're looking for three unbiased reviews each for Katana and FishBowl, separate from their case studies. While G2 and similar sites are useful, we\u2019re particularly interested in testimonials regarding the integration of HubSpot CRM with either FishBowl or Katana. We\u2019re concerned that the HubSpot native connections offered by both may not function as intended, similar to our past experience with ODOO, which had integration issues. I believe Katana and FishBowl should handle deal information from HubSpot well, but I would greatly appreciate any personal experiences, testimonials, or feedback about this integration. If you need more context, please let me know! Thank you for any insights or suggestions for alternative sources of information beyond G2 or SoftwareAdvice.com.",

I\u2019ve done numerous Katana implementations and advising (I was on their founding team) and have worked in Hubspot with sales. \n\nFor your use-case are you trying to get custom information associated with a hubspot deal into the ERP? Just curious, since you are doing custom wood-workings. \n\nOne major difference with Katana and Fishbowl is that Fishbowl doesn\u2019t have a robust Shop floor functionality nor a make to order workflow which is functionally important for custom manufacturing. Both do inventory processes and BOMs just fine. \n\nIf Make.com has the capability to tap into all elements of the Katana sales API then you can put details of your CRM deal from Hubspot into multiple parts of a Katana sales order. This would include sales order notes/comments, line item specific metadata (<===use that for a custom make to order manufacturing process available in paperless format for floor team) and lastly the new custom fields available in the Katana platform which is currently in Beta (not sure if API is open to that endpoint yet)\n\nIn general, these would be the possibilities for your integration to sales order details. I\u2019m not sure there are enough use cases yet covering the hubspot integration via make.com to even draw in an opinion to this since every use-case has some nuances in the workflow.",

Base it off of sales volume rather than prices and promos.  \n\nExample if in one week, store A sells 200/500 Samsung Galaxy S23s then order 100 to replenish their inventory \n\nA quick note with this method, depending on your purchase order lead time you can either order more or less (I have a 90 day lead time for my purchase orders so I generally order extra qty)\n\nAnother option for you is what I call inventory transfers. Let's say the Google Pixel Fold is selling quite well at store C (21 on hand) (30 sold in two weeks) but experiencing slow sales at store A (89 on hand) (9 sold in two weeks) you can inventory transfer 25 units from store A to replenish store C rather than placing a new purchase order. \n\nAlso is it possible for your 3 managers to cut their purchase orders back to once a week? Twice a week is possibly too often and might be creating stale inventory. \n\nJust a quick caveat, I'm not sure how much inventory you're able to stock per your 3 stores, so adjust my hypothetical figures accordingly. (I deal in qtys of 100s and operate a 55,000 sq ft warehouse and a 30,000 sq ft warehouse.) So I am just accustomed to dealing with quite a bit of space for my product. \n\nTL;DR, I believe the inventory transfer method can help you the most with your current stale inventory and have your 3 managers base your future purchase orders off of weekly sales volume and less off of promos and prices.",

Our financial operations link to Xero, and we've invested heavily in Magento invoice shipping templates, using each platform for paperwork and dispatch. All channels integrate with Royal Mail Click and Drop or DHL Express Commerce.

                "content": "The last thing any implementation needs is setting itself up for failure by rushing and not making a proper plan and timeline. I've dealt with many clients who overestimate the benefits and underestimate the costs (workload, time, money, skills required) of getting a new system. Not to mention the additional costs of choosing the wrong system or using an inexperienced implementation firm that sends a sales rep who sells you on a system that will do \"all that AND THEN SOME!\" I've even advised a client not to upgrade because their current system provided the timely, accurate, and reliable managerial reports they needed to make informed business decisions.\n\nSo, take your time, slow your roll, and start by forming an implementation team that can thoroughly assess the \"current state\" and \"future state\" of your company and help lead a successful implementation. That's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend. To save time and help you plan your project, use AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to create a complete step-by-step implementation plan built upon best practices of project management. Tailor the methodology for a \\[industry\\] company with \\[# employees\\] and {annual} in revenue from \\[list revenue streams\\].\n\nMake sure to thoroughly vet any consultant's by reviewing their professional experience on their LinkedIn.  I'm currently wrapping up a implementation that started our efforts and discussions around Katana, then providing a 2-day walk-through visit by two \"consultants\" and then to a full 180 when they suggested we go with CIN7 because it had features Katana didn't. I can't help to feel that these guys totally pulled a bait-and-switch on my buddies shop!  Learn from my own mistake and request many demos, especially around system functionality and integration abilities so you can make your final purchase decision confidently.  Well, the two ended leaving that company and forming one of their own.  My buddies had no choice to continue using them because you're not supposed to switch consultants mid-implemention like that.  DM me if you want the name of the firm.   \n  \nI definitely spent WAAAAY to much time writing this out but gladly do it again if it helps prevent someone from getting bamboozled by these fake consultants.  Congrats on your growing business and wish you the best on your implementation!",

Since the bins are frequently rearranged when pulling products for shipping, we need something that updates automatically. Any suggestions?",

        "content": "Hello everyone! I recently started a new job focused on improving our inventory processes. My inventory consists of parts for industrial machine repairs, but there's a communication gap between the shop crew and the purchasing department. Sometimes, the shop crew takes parts for jobs without notifying purchasing, leading us to backtrack when we notice discrepancies. I propose using QR codes on the inventory parts that link to a form. When filled out, this form will update a spreadsheet with the part and job numbers, allowing us to allocate costs correctly. Since every shop employee has a tablet to scan QR codes, I believe this could be an effective solution. While I see potential for future expansion, I'm unsure about the company's technological resources for further automation. If anyone has experience creating a QR code system and can share tips, I would appreciate it! I'm currently aiming for a no-cost solution that I can manage myself. The inventory volume is manageable right now, so I think a simple approach like this could work until I can develop a more advanced system.",

The card is also sent to the person managing inventory and BOM.  The inventory manager makes the adjustment if needed , then investigates if the BOM is incorrect. \n\nAnother note , if you use the QR codes , it\u2019s helpful for the receiving department to label every part that is received with the QR code. Adding a location could be helpful too .\n\n If the company wants to invest into this , I would look into RF plus . It integrates with different ERP software.

No system is going to physically stop people from just taking shit without recording it. Again, I don't know specifics but even a simple kanban card might work.

I have a water recycling system that takes in dirty water, which either goes for disposal or is held in a buffer tank for treatment. The volume of water to be recycled (rec in) is slightly greater than the amount actually recycled (rec out). This recycled water then goes to a pit that has a set evaporation offset before reaching the customer (demand). I need to compare these volumes to identify discrepancies in the system. There may be unreported supply or demand, or inaccuracies in the recycling measurements. I have some preliminary ideas but would appreciate fresh, unbiased suggestions that might help solve the issue. If any new ideas lead to solutions, I can certainly incorporate them.",

I discovered a poorly organized Excel sheet, and despite trying to improve it with various versions, I'm still not satisfied. The volume of materials is large, and manually entering 50 serial numbers repeatedly to update their status from \"stored\" to \"sent\" feels tedious. Price isn't an issue for us since we send materials to other locations without charging or purchasing; we simply distribute what arrives. It's crucial to keep a record of all serial numbers for each product, along with the date, location, serial number, and incident number after sending. I'm unsure whether to invest in specialized software or to find a better Excel template to adapt. What do you recommend? Thank you!",

Also, you would need accurate (reasonably) recipes for all menu items that are sold, so that you can break down the ingredients that are needed. You would also need to consider the minimum order quantity depending on the supplier, lead time, and par levels for each SKU. The complexity increases with commissary/central kitchen models. I run a company that does inventory, but prediction is something I didn't get into. Most operators were happy with par levels, suggested orders, etc.",

This allows for easier and more accurate tracking, as you can scan the barcode when sheets are received, used, or replenished. It also enables integration with inventory management software.\n\n2. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification): RFID tags can be attached to each sheet, and RFID readers placed at various locations in your facility can automatically detect and track the movement of the sheets. This method provides real-time visibility and eliminates the need for manual counting.\n\n3. Weight sensors: If the weight of the sheets is consistent and can be measured accurately, you can use weight sensors or load cells placed on storage racks or shelves. The system can monitor the weight changes to determine when sheets are added or removed.\n\n4. Visual indicators: You can implement a visual signaling system using colored tags or markers to indicate the quantity of sheets in stock. For example, using red tags when the stock is low and green tags when it's sufficient. This method provides a quick visual reference, but it still relies on manual observation.\n\nIf you need some custom Software or similar, feel free to DM me :)",

They are currently categorizing items by code and storing them alongside similar materials, but the organization is informal. While every rack has a number, these numbers aren't integrated into the system. When items are received, they are logged into our ERP for inventory tracking and then manually recorded in an Excel sheet to indicate their location. I aim to improve this process to enhance efficiency in stock management and provide real-time inventory visibility. Currently, when items are issued to departments, they disappear from our ERP stock list but remain in the Excel locator until manually updated during weekly stock checks. I propose integrating locators into our ERP and assigning each item a designated locator. This would clarify item locations and automatically update the system when items are removed, eliminating manual tasks and minimizing errors. Has anyone implemented a similar system in their company? Is it worth considering from a cost-benefit perspective? Any suggestions on how to proceed?",

After researching and trying various trial licenses, I decided to ask for suggestions. The client-facing needs include: 1. Login restricted to predetermined clients 2. Ability to rent and book equipment for specific dates 3. Categorization of equipment 4. Pricing calculations based on daily, weekly, or monthly rates 5. Potential client-specific discounts 6. Payment via credit card or purchase order reference 7. Exclusion of pickup date from pricing.\n\nFor our internal inventory management, we need: 1. Equipment as individual items that can also be part of a kit 2. Marking items as inactive due to defects or theft 3. Items inactive due to expired calibration 4. Document attachment for equipment (like calibration certificates) 5. Simplified check-in/check-out process (considering barcodes or QR codes) 6. Printable rental forms with serial numbers and a comment section for client signatures upon pickup 7. Standard depreciation and insurance tracking 8. Invoice generation.\n\nMost existing solutions are too cumbersome, but I realize the wishlist might lead to such options. I remember seeing an unfinished solution on Reddit but can't locate it now. We are open to paying a reasonable amount and are considering all types of solutions, like WordPress plugins. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

We usually stock extra items that typically need replacement and materials for equipment installation. For instance, when we order a parking gate with an intercom and loops, we generally have the filler and loop in stock, but need to order the gate and intercom. Similarly, we might receive cameras for a customer that are sold within the same week. We deal with many low-quantity items annually, as well as some high-quantity ones. Currently, we lack a proper inventory tracking system; we only perform a year-end count without any insight into what has been added or removed throughout the year, apart from billed items. I'm sure there's a more efficient way to organize this without requiring complex software. Can anyone assist?",

We have over 8,000 unique SKUs in TAM Intelliware, and it's quite disorganized. My main concern is that I recently purchased some socks, many of which are already in our system. However, the prices vary\u2014some were bought at higher prices in the last order and others at lower prices. Should I manually adjust the purchase price? Won't that affect previous records and leave me without past cost information? If I don\u2019t update to current purchase prices, our COGS will be inaccurate. I also want to avoid creating a new entry for the same item. Is there a resource where I can learn about this? I feel like I'm navigating this alone, and there doesn't seem to be a consistent method for managing our inventory and records. I\u2019d like to simplify things and establish a better process.",

For example, if I need to buy 150 units of an item available in two sizes, with a 1:1 sales ratio for large and medium sizes, I'd buy 75 units of each. How can I calculate the required quantities if the ratio changes, such as 3.3:1 or 1.8:1?",

This seems really complicated since I have so many items. Is this really necessary? What's the easiest way to manage the costs and selling prices for my records and taxes? I thought about noting the ASIN for each item I lost along with the purchase cost, and then at the start of next year, I could check my Amazon orders for those ASINs to record their selling prices. Would this be effective? For items that didn't sell, should I just list those on a new paper for next year?",

We're using Scout TopShelf for inventory management, and I'm working on establishing reorder points and economic order quantities for our 20 most frequently ordered hardware items. I've researched extensively, reading around 20 articles on inconsistent demand, reorder points, and EOQ, and I also hold a bachelor's degree in operations where I studied these topics. However, I\u2019m struggling to set reasonable reorder points due to our seasonal demand. Can anyone advise me on how to establish sensible yet conservative reorder points and EOQ for this seasonal demand? Should I adjust the formulas quarterly, or would it be better to implement safety stock? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!",

I can set up a database in Excel or Access to catalog the products and their information. However, my boss wants to introduce a barcode or QR code system for future inventory management. I can generate unique barcodes for each product and update their labels accordingly. I realize that adding new products will require manual entry into the database to include the new label and barcode. My main question is whether there's a way to set up a system that removes the corresponding product from the database when a barcode is scanned. If Excel or Access isn't suitable for this, I would appreciate any software recommendations. Please let me know if you need more details, as I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and would appreciate any assistance. Thank you.",

        "content": "Recognizing a niche market and a consistent client base, I decided to enhance my approach beyond merely referring business to brokers by obtaining broker authority. I reached out to two familiar carriers I've worked with extensively, each having 4-6 skilled drivers, to see if they would be interested in taking on a few over-dimensional loads each month. They informed me that their insurance payment was just made, and their authority would be on hold before Christmas. They are overwhelmed with work, and I suspect they may not be in the country legally, fearing that trucking through weigh stations could lead to deportation. I've known these individuals for over a decade, and while I could be mistaken, cash flow doesn\u2019t seem to be the issue. I'm starting to wonder how many carriers and drivers aren't fully documented U.S. citizens, which could potentially remove a significant number of drivers from the roads\u2014possibly over 30%. Companies like \"Jim and John\u2019s Lumber Co\" (fictitious) will likely be shocked when full truckloads cost $4.50/mile instead of the previously low rates of $1.80/mile. January is shaping up to be a politically significant month for me, even compared to January 2020.",

Do you seriously believe 30% of the truck drivers out there are illegals? 1 million truck drivers out there have fake CDLs, fake social security numbers, fake bank accounts, got insured, spend every day on the road, risk getting inspections by DOT or to get pulled over by a cop, risk getting investigsted if they get in an accident, the company who hired them willingly took the risk, scammed their insurance, assigned them equipment worth 10s or hundreds of thousands of dollars, decided to take a risk instead of hiring an Indian H1B or Ukrainian refugee quite legaly and probably cheaper....\n\n\nIf you believe that you are insane and I'm starting to doubt your story - you have no idea what the paperwork, rules, regulations, responsibilities and risks of being a carrier are.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd you don't seem to remember how the last time Trump slapped tarrifs and started a trade war he absolutely devastated the freight market pre-covid.\u00a0",
