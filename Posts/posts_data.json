We mostly store Plastic Granules  ( LDPE, HDPE, PP , PVC Powder and many more ), they come in thin 25kg bags . Recently manufacturers have sent us multiple debit notes when asked upon they tell us it\u2019s because of multiple bag tear while loading the truck. We tried to get to the bottom of it and realised that the reason for bag tear were the hooks of the truck that are used for tying tarpaulin. This is totally out of our control but what could be the possible ways to minimise these tear? ",

        "content": "I\u2019m actually the buyer in this particular scenario, but I sell on etsy, too. I would have handled it differently but I am curious what other people think.\n\nI had an item get damaged in shipment. I ordered ink jet prints, third time buying from this seller, and the package got wet somewhere in transit, ruining some of the prints. I immediately took pictures of the package and prints, did my best to salvage what I could, and contacted the seller right away.\n\nTheir response was to basically say wow that sucks, suggest that I file a postal claim and offered to send reprints if I paid for the shipping.\n\nI have to admit I felt underwhelmed by this response. If I were the seller, I would have handled the postal claim from my end or at the very least provided a direct link to the usps site for how to do that. And I wouldn\u2019t have asked someone to pay more money for an item that arrived damaged. If anything felt hinky, I would have probably had them return the damaged item, but with images that very clearly showed damage (in my case the ink had run through the prints), I would have just remade the item and resent. \n\nIt was a $40 order so nothing crazy and I needed the prints for a client project so I paid th shipping fee, but tbh the way they handled it made me reconsider purchasing from them in the future. I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t fair, because I realize it wasn\u2019t their fault the package got wet (tho really I feel they should probably package taking into account that could happen!) and even if I filed a claim, I\u2019d be out that shipping cost. I just didn\u2019t feel very valued as a customer (a repeat one no less) whereas if they had handled it differently, I\u2019d have been a client for life. Okay, yes, not a huge order but I\u2019d anticipated 2-3 orders a month from them, which sure they didn\u2019t know.\n\nHow do you handle damaged items?",

Proper packing will negate 95% of poor handling. Once as a buyer I got a box that looked like an accordion.  I expected the worst since the items inside were very fragile.  There was almost no damage at all because they were packed well.",

In the UK under distance selling regulations you would be within your rights to return an item for a full refund no questions asked. \n\n\n\nWhere communications have failed I'd have opened a case on that one with etsy (I would have pushed more for a resolve first, but its not up to me the buyer to put things right). Their service sucks. As the seller they are responsible for getting your item to you in good quality, that includes using packaging that withstands weather and being battered through the postal system. It is the sellers responsibility. As it arrived damaged and you sent images as proof, I'd have refunded or resent whichever was your preference, then it is up to the seller to reclaim the expense via the postal service. If an item is lost in the post I dont ask the buyer to pay again, you resend or refund then claim back the extra cost from the postal service, part and parcel of running a business is accepting a little expense now and again because something went wrong. Its not the sellers fault but to be so laissez faire over it well that service sucks and isn't acceptable.\n\n\n\nSellers like that just pee me off and shouldn't be trading. We are all in this to make a profit but sellers like that think only of their pockets and no doubt they would be screaming banshees if they received a damaged item in the post and were told \"no refunds\"",

It should\u2019ve been either wrapped in plastic or shipped in a plastic envelope.

If it\u2019s damaged, I\u2019d just make sure they send pics (& in your case I\u2019d probably ask for the packaging to be in the pic to prove the shipping carrier did it & you didn\u2019t get them wet yourself). If parts of the product were salvageable (in this case obviously not), I might ask them to send it back but that\u2019s the most work I\u2019d make them go through. After I file the claim, if it\u2019s for a damaged item I send the replacement right away without waiting for the results because I know it can take a while.

(If it\u2019s for a non-delivery, I typically wait until the results come back - unless there\u2019s something clearly showing it wasn\u2019t delivered like the city it was delivered at is wrong which just happened to me recently & it was UPS\u2019s mistake.)\n\nThis seller 100% handled this wrong. They should\u2019ve taken care of it themselves. And if they lost money, they should take it as a learning experience & average it out to factor it into their prices.

                "content": "Unfortunately it sounds like this seller's bottom line is more important than customer service. A growing trend. Maybe they don't get many repeat customers or understand that repeat customers also give recommends for future sales.\n\nOn that note though, parcels getting wet is a majority of the fault of USPS, UPS, FedEx or any of the other shippers. We have a contract carrier for our USPS delivery who has left packages in the worst spots even though we have a covered front porch. They have even left it in front of a rain downspout while it is raining, in front of a garage to backed over from the exiting vehicle... All, the fault of the delivery service.\n\nHowever, my post office said the shipping and the insurance are ordered when the package is mailed, meaning that the person sending the item is the one responsible for making sure that the insurance is activated, not the person receiving the item (I wasn't allowed to start a claim they told me I had to get a hold of the seller communicate the damage to them and that they should start it with the post office that they shipped from). The buyer needs to make the seller aware of the issue, which you did; from there the seller should have taken care of the shipping through the shipping company, not by recharging you as the customer.\n\nOn one hand, they may feel it is not their fault that the item got wet, but that doesn't make it your fault either. Additionally, we are told constantly to make sure that we properly package items to ensure that they arrive in the same order as displayed. I've been a long time buyer, but only a recent seller and with only selling one item so far I guess I'm really lucky that I haven't run into this yet since most of my items are not something I can replace, I would just have to give a full refund.",

Instead, we aligned the time stamp of significant events that we recorded with the GPS location of the truck, ship, plane or facility where the package was at the time.\n\nThe devices aren't disposable. They aren't really \"cheap\". My employer invested about $200k in the devices, but we used them all the time.\n\nThe people at IST are top notch and can help get a solution for you. They even have rental equipment.\n\nRather than trying to determine when and where the damage is occurring, you might try bluffing by labelling the package with bright yellow/orange stickers that read, \"**Warning! Cargo Handling is being electronically monitored. Shock and vibration monitor enclosed.**\" or something like that.",

There are a pretty wide variety at different price points but I've heard good things about Shippo and have personally used ShipStation in the past.\n\nSupplies is a different thing. There are several places where you can order things in bulk but depending on volume that may or may not be feasible. One of the most well known bulk shipping supply companies is ULine If you're utilizing USPS they offer things like mailers and boxes used for their flat rate options for free.",

The shipping software (shiprush, shippingeasy, shippo),  should immediately get you cheaper pricing than over the counter. I should also working through web start your sentence shipping notification emails to include tracking and eliminate all manual input of addresses. You should also be able to set up rules within the software to assign package sizes and weights based on what the customer has ordered. When I print labels, I select the orders I want to ship and hit one button to print them all, because I have automation rules all set up.\n\nI recommend the rollo printer, It's cheap and it accepts any type of thermal label. For example you don't want to have to buy the zebra labels for your zebra printer.\n\nAfter you get all this going you can start looking into your own shipping accounts. Get your own commercial account with UPS and FedEx and see how that compares to the commercial pricing that you're probably already getting through your shipping software. You can / should be able to use your own accounts with the shipping software. I use a combination of USPS, two UPS accounts and FedEx to get the cheapest price depending on package size and destination. I was also able to let all these accounts compete against each other to drive pricing down.... Even my two UPS accounts (home with UPS directly and one with a reseller) compete against each other.",

For wine glasses, sometimes I'll roll packing paper just over the stem to even out the shape, and then use another couple sheets like any other fragile item.  \n\nIf you pack the box right, you should be able to throw it across the room without breaking anything inside!

For small prints I have an art folder that's pretty big that they zip into. \n\nBut for paintings and frames I get a large box that I usually can't tape up at the top cause my pictures are too big so I have to be really careful with it and I wrap each painting/frame in a blanket or towel. You may have to tape them on to secure them. Be careful not to ruin the painting with the tape, I usually use painter's tape. \n\nAnd with jewelry, I just put that in a little jewelry box and tape the box closed to it won't open on me.

Even with the added shipping cost it's a great value. \n\n* A single roll will crumple up to void fill many times the space that an equivalent amount of bubble wrap or peanuts would\n* Overall price works out to be much cheaper\n* The rolls take up very little storage space compared to bubble or peanuts\n* Renewable, recyclable, and biodegradable to reduce plastic and styrofoam waste \n* Does an excellent job of holding products securely and cushioning them\n\nGive it a try, you and your customers might be pleasantly surprised.",

        "content": "Hi - I'm still a very new store on Etsy. 2.5 months in.  I'm UK based selling Print On Demand goods.  My print provider has both UK and US print shops and my store is set-up for both UK and US sales.  My US sales were few and far between in the beginning but have recently trended up to 2-3 per day.  I offer Free Shipping in both the UK and US.  Despite having a print shop in the US the shipping costs are pretty high.  The POD offers me three options:  \n\n\n1. Budget = USPS First Class Post\n2. Standard = USPS Priority Mail  \n3. Express = ??? (I've not used it as the cost is more than triple my product cost)\n\n\"Standard\" is double the cost of \"Budget\".  From your experience (as a US buyer or US seller), what do US customers expect to get on a Free Shipping Etsy purchase in the US ?  Is \"USPS Priority Mail\" really worth paying double the price for?\n\n  \nNote: I'm currently using \"Standard\" shipping for all my orders but due to the cost of  \"USPS Priority Mail\", I just break even (or even make a small loss).  This is more a hobby to get my fun art into the world and the US sales were so small I'd ignored the financials assuming my work resonated more with the UK market. As the sales are now picking up I'm faced with either raising my base prices or changing my default shipping.  Any advice / input would be much appreciated.\n\n ",

                "content": "Hello! I would recommend signing up for a shipping comparison site like [Pirate Ship](https://pirateship.com). It's completely free and gives you discounts on labels with some major shipping carriers like USPS and UPS. It also lets you fill out customs forms online and purchase insurance if you'd like.\n\nFor cases like yours, Pirate Ship actually has a super-cheap international service called [Simple Export Rate](https://pirateship.com/simple-export-rate). For 4lb packages, it's going to cost $37 to ship it anywhere in the world. The downside is that, to make it so cheap, they generally try and get a lot of packages and then ship them in bulk to the destination country. Since I can't imagine the countries you're shipping to are very high-traffic destinations, it might take a long time before the packages leaves the US.\n\nTherefore, it might be worth checking out some other similar services like USPS FCPI or UPS Worldwide Expedited (both of which can be bought through Pirate Ship). It will be a little more expensive (possibly $55-75), but it will likely arrive faster, especially if you use UPS.\n\nAlso keep in mind that almost none of the countries you're shipping to will have tracking once the package leaves the USA. This might be something you already knew, but I just wanted to make sure it was on your radar.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

And any important info **needs** to go in the listing images; even then make it the 2nd or 3rd pic or they will miss it. \n* Updating listings. Etsy offers some catch-all shortcuts but they're all useless for me. If I ever have to update prices for a couple of variables, add a new variable etc, I have to do it manually for every listing. I really wish they offered a 'product profile' feature like Vela that I could apply to all same-product listings. \n* Shipping costs are in a constant state of flux (but this affects all sellers everywhere). \n* Shoppers expecting AmazonPrime-level service and speed. \"I like it but decided I want a different one can I send it back for free and get a free resend?\" \"Hi I ordered this 2 days ago and it still hasn't arrived\". Most customers are great however. \n\nA lot of issues you'll face = just standard online commerce hurdles. Outside of that, the more time you invest in prep and presentation, the easier your life will be.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/1istqsr60zed1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ecf6fe0663891dee3dea0a0ade8c3cbf7c90013\n\nPeak season is a time of year when shipping carriers experience a surge in volume. This can lead to longer delivery times, increased shipping costs, and potential delays. However, there are a few things you can do to help ensure your packages arrive on time during peak season\n\n  \n**Plan Ahead**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gohcpdap0zed1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf1ee2f9b34e69bf0a2594d31e09fd9d419aab0e\n\n  \nOne of the best ways to avoid shipping delays during peak season is to plan ahead. This means ordering and shipping your packages as early as possible. You should also be aware of the peak shipping season for your industry and start planning accordingly.\n\n  \n**Choose the Right Shipping Carrier**\n\nNot all shipping carriers are created equal. Some carriers are better equipped to handle the increased volume of packages during peak season. It's important to choose a carrier that has a good reputation for on-time delivery and customer service.\n\n**Use the Right Shipping Options**\n\nThere are a variety of shipping options available, and it's important to choose the right one for your needs. If you need your package to arrive quickly, you may want to consider using an expedited shipping service. However, these services can be more expensive. If you're not in a hurry, you can save money by using a standard shipping service. \u00a0\n\n\n\n**Pack Your Packages Properly**\n\nProperly packing your packages is essential for ensuring they arrive safely. Be sure to use sturdy boxes and plenty of packing material. You should also clearly label your packages with the recipient's address and your return address. \u00a0\n\n\n\n**Provide Accurate Shipping Information**\n\nIt's important to provide accurate shipping information when you create your shipping label. This includes the recipient's name, address, and phone number. You should also include your own name, address, and phone number in case the package needs to be returned. \u00a0\n\n\n\n**Confirm Your Shipment**\n\nOnce you've shipped your package, be sure to confirm your shipment with the carrier. This will give you a tracking number so you can monitor the progress of your package.\n\n**Be Patient**\n\nDuring peak season, it's important to be patient. Shipping carriers are experiencing a high volume of packages, so there may be some delays. If your package is delayed, don't hesitate to contact the carrier for an update. \u00a0\n\n\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Ship your packages during off-peak hours.\n* Consider using a shipping service that offers free shipping.\n* Use a shipping service that offers insurance. \n* Keep a copy of your shipping label and tracking number.\n* Be aware of the shipping restrictions for your chosen carrier.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help ensure that your packages arrive on time during peak season.",

I now buy from Walmart instead because I found that many of the products on Amazon are also available on Walmart's website, often at lower prices. For example, I ordered Kibo snacks from Amazon, but they took over 3 weeks to arrive. Because of the delay, I had to buy more snacks from Walmart anyway, so I didn't end up saving any money. \n\nI ordered the Kibo chips from Walmart yesterday and received them in just 1 day. It's clear that due to the poor service, Walmart is the better option for ordering nowadays.",

Late last week I got a notice that it was arriving early, July 29.  Then that part of it shipped.  I looked at the test meter on the website, same and only vendor, on Sunday, the 28th.  It was showing they had 6 available, could have one by Tuesday, the 30th if I ordered in 3 hours or Friday, Aug 2nd with free shipping.  Yesterday the syrups arrived, the meter shows some tracking sitting in California for 3 days now.   So they entice new orders with fast delivery on the same item, meanwhile it's been 2 weeks and I don't have mine.  Also if they were going to deliver it separately, why did I wait 2 weeks to get some sugar free syrup?  I buy mostly from Ebay and while Amazon was great in the past, it seems to be slipping lately. Ebay stuff from China gets delivered faster.",

Last week I recieved a 7 dollar item that was broken. I was literally interrogated by the CS rep. They want photos of 8 different angels and they want photos of the box and so many questions. I've been shopping at Amazon since 2007 and I've only returned five products and claimed damage on three so there is no reason at all to treat me with suspicion. This is not how they used to do things. I'm 100% canceling my prime this year. I'm basically subsidizing fraud.",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI recently went through a crisis of conscience about how much plastic waste shipping magic cards makes, and since yano... the worlds on fire, I figured I\u2019d pass along my findings:\n\n**Top-loaders**: With UltraPro and BCW currently on backorder now is the best time to look into a cheaper, more sustainable option. While searching \u201c3 inch by 4\u201d inch cardboard\u201d didn\u2019t get me anywhere fast, it led me to *3\u201d* *by* *4.5\u201d* *Cardboard* *Sleeves*. These can be found at currently half the price or less than ultra pro top-loaders and in a pinch can be quickly chopped in half to get double the uses out of them. \n\n**Tape**: For tape, look for products that say *Biodegradable* or *Cellulose-based*. It may be a little more pricey than scotch tape or shipping tape, but it means any cardboard or paper you tape on will be free to decompose and not slowed or stopped by a plastic tape layer. \n\n**Sleeves**: I haven\u2019t found anything yet and don\u2019t think I will. Because sleeve have to be really low friction there really aren\u2019t a lot of non-plastics that would fit the bill.\n\n**Bubble Mailers** **and** **Envelopes**: There are biodegradable options out there but they are still generally quite expensive compared to the other options. One quick tip is buy gummed envelopes instead of the pre-moistened ones with a plastic strip protecting the glue. I know licking envelopes sucks but you can avoid that too by just running a damp paper towel over the adhesive to activate it. These envelope are generally cheaper and you put one less piece of plastic in a landfill. \n\nThank you to anyone who reads this. I know the shipping aspect of MtG finance is not often touched but since we are a significant percentage of the people buying envelopes and shipping product these days I thought it\u2019d be good to share some tips. If anyone has an ideas to add to this post please reach out! None of us are as smart as all of us!\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your stories. A lot of you pointed towards the concept of reusing and I\u2019d like to say I totally agree. If someone sends you a top-loader save it to use it for someone else!",

                "content": "[rant]\nConcern for sustainability is applauded, but the general vilification of plastics is misguided. Plastic in itself is not an issue, it serves an important function as packaging for a multitude of products. Sleeves, for instance, have very low weight while protecting the cards (lower than paper), and weight impacts fuel consumption. Reusing sleeves, as a lot of people in this thread do, is also very good. The issues ares when plastic goes places it should not be, and single-use of items that could be reused. \n\nBiodegradable products often have lesser performance and are more resource-intensive to produce (I think). Why do you need your tape to be biodegradable? Are you going to throw it away outside? In fact, it being biodegradable and then going to a landfill could be considered worse as degrading organic matter in a sealed down oxygen-deprived landfill would produce methane gas, which is many times stronger than CO2. Cellulose-baseds plastics only thing going for it would be if it its whole lifecycle consumes fewer resources than petrol-plastics, as it in itself is carbon-neutral.\n\nAlso, the production of paper (from cellulose) is more resource-intensive than plastics, in addition to its lower performance (not standing up to water, for instance). Recycled paper products, on the other hand, are quite efficient. The good thing about cardboard packaging is that it can be recycled at a very high quality.\n\nThe fact that some countries use landfills instead of co-heat/electricity incineration plants is on them. It is bad use of resources and a result of cheap land, low economic development or outdated environmental policies. Did you know that metals such as iron, aluminium and gold are recovered from the bottom ash producted in waste incineration?",

What i do is tell a customer that we are sorry that there was a problem with the product please provide us with a picture or a video of the damaged item, once I get the video/photo what ever and I deem that it is indeed FUBARed I then offer them an exchange or a full refund. I then tell them to keep the product as our brand is trying to help cut down the carbon foot print of both our company as well as the customers in general.  Then it is up to the customer to get rid of the product. High ticket items I have simply told them to get in contact with DHL (who i use for high ticket sales as it was furniture) and that they will be responsible for the shipping cost, the shipping cost would be taken out of their refund, or offer an exchange once I got the product back and as long as it wasnt already assembled.",

        "content": "I'm trying to figure out the best method  that makes sense for both my business and the consumer when it comes to returns and refunds but am struggling to find the best approach. There are essentially 3 scenarios I'm dealing with at the moment.\n\n* I pay for about 50% of the shipping.\n\n1) Customer just isn't happy with the product for whichever reason. \n\nThis one is probably the easiest to handle. They paid a flat shipping fee to receive there product but will now have to pay the full shipping cost to send it back. Once inspected we issue a full refund. \n\n2) Customer received a defective item\n\nThis one is the hardest to swallow but at the end of the day I understand these are costs we will need to absorb. We pay for the entire shipping and send a brand new item. The old items stays with the customer as we won't expect them to pay for the shipping back and what's the point for us to pay for the shipping just to receive a defective item ( we don't have replacement parts for our product right now)\n\n3) this one seems to be the trickiest of them all. Customer is not so happy with the product but also is complaining that's its not really working as they intended. An in between of scenario 1 and 2. Now the entire shipping was paid by me because it was over a certain amount. So does that mean I should pay for the shipping back + send them a new one and pay for that shipping as well?\n\nMy refund and return policy is as follows:\n\nIf item is defective we pay for return shipping costs ( if we want it back). We either issue a refund or send out a new product which we also pay the shipping costs for.  ( cost of doing business)\n\nCustomer is responsible for paying the shipping if it's the wrong size, no longer want it or it's the wrong product.\n\n\n\nWould be great to hear how others have there refund policies setup.\n\nCheers.",

Of course the big fashion retailers (e.g. ASOS) do free returns, but they factor that into the cost, and they have huge returns rate, which is why some of these companies are reconsidering.\n\nRe: defective items - a little trick we've been doing for a few years, is if it's for example a small defect like a black mark, missing button or something we do the following:\n\n1. Offer a discount on the item if the customer wants to keep it (usually discount of about 30%)\n2. Alternatively we say they can return and we'll pay for return cost\n\nWe hope they choose option 1 as any defective item is worthless to us anyway, we can resell at a discount in our shop but it's more hassle than it's worth and we have to pay to get it returned to us. Probably 2 out of 3 customers choose option 1. If customer accepts option 1, happy days, we've got our cost back on a worthless product. If they choose option 2 (which is a bluff), we just say \"actually, my manager has said you can keep the item, we'll dispatch a new one\", as it's not worth getting a defective item returned.",

        "content": "I'm doing some research and would be happy to hear your opinions - specifically in the apparel sector, but not only.   \n\n\nReturns are rising and can reach up to 25% of online purchases. I read that many merchants can't offer free returns and that most of the returns are not sold but thrown away. In addition, the reverse logistics process is pricey, 1.5X compared to forward logistics. Also, the process taken in the warehouse has a negative impact on the business - I read somewhere these costs could be up to 60% of the prime cost of an item (not high-value items).  \n\n\nHave you implemented in your store any solution that aims to face this problem?   \nDo you have a strategy to handle these returns?   \n\n\nAny thoughts on this subject are welcome. Thanks!",

Otherwise you could be subject to false chargeback claims (ie, a buyer uses a stolen card to make a purchase, then asks for you to issue the refund to a different card, then the original card owner makes a chargeback claim against you for a fraudulent charge).\n\nThis rigid shipping/return policy only works because I am selling niche products with few, and in some cases, no, competitors.

        "content": "TDLR: Never bother returning anything even with free returns,  just get a partial refund and cut your losses or you might be out of pocket for your money and the items.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know never to even bother trying to return anything to china, the cost to send something back and the risk of it getting lost and the seller claiming to not receiving it is just not worth it as there is a huge risk you'll be out your money and the order. And ss advised by others, always just dispute with \"refund no return\" and get aliexpress to give you a partial refund of some sort.\n\nBut I've used the \"free returns\" service successfully until now.  \nItem dimensions where incorrect, but my order had the free returns service and I thought I would rather have a full refund instead of partial and keeping the item. So I apply for full refund and aliexpress give me a free return shipping label and I drop it off like before.\n\nBut then a couple days later I get an email saying the seller has queried my return request, and to check the return page. But there was nothing there so I think nothing of it. But just today I get another email from aliexpress saying they have deemed my reason to be valid and are giving me a partial refund of 50%. I managed to get someone on the chat and they basically said that the partial refund was for me to keep the item. When I pointed out that I had already sent back my order using the shipping label they provided, they didn't seem to be able to do anything and just advised to to contact the seller to give me a full refund. The problem is the \"free return\" service is a service provided by aliexpress, not the seller, the return shipping label they give sends items back to a local processing managed by aliexpress where they verify I have returned the items and then they issue me the refund. The seller is not involved in this at all, so the seller is under no obligation to give me a full refund especially now aliexpress has deemed that I should get 50% refund.   \n\n\nTo call their system janky is an understatement IMO, their search barely works, they had issues with their free returns system earlier this year, where it just didn't issue the return shipping labels.  \nThis time it looks like even though I have free returns, and my return was approved and the shipping label issued, the seller was able to try and dispute my return reason after it was approved, at which point it was escalated to some aliexpress team who deemed my reason was valid and and would issue me a partial refund and no return. somehow overriding the fact that my request for a full refund had already been approved and a shipping label had already been issued, and that I had already sent back the order.\n\n&#x200B;",

Very deceptive, I left without items they refunded me my shipping cost but I PAID For USPS shipping total $65 on February 29 this year and after contacting yesterday sitting on my phone chatting with their so called Help Center, 5 hours total, They refused to me even their so called supervisor who was trying to guide me with orders like I'm small child, I have tons of experience with return on EBay, I contact merchants in China I never had such bullshitting experience as I do now with my free return with AliExpress, this is very deceptive, I lost this merchandise I sent to them 11 items paying 65 US Dollars, not their f.n Chinese money, in US Dollars, but this Marxist service posed as business steals my merchandise, yes they refund me in full, except they refuse to refund my paid by me shipping charges for USPS, I already sent them 2 pair of cheap flip flops in March 8, just last Friday, now learned that I simple paid $17.20 for two separate packages, their practice to tell customer of very deceptive one item per shipping or return label, but now I have no shoes what will get refunded, but not a shipping fee I paid, so another word now I have returned 13 items total cost for purchasing them using cheap pricing like $50, but paid $80 for shipping them for \"free return with AliExpress\" to USPS, I can't even dispute that with my PayPal or Discover uses to pay for shipping back. Well I don't go broke, thanks for paid off all my debt month to month principles, I know now that AliExpress, Temu are used deceptive practice for \"free return\" and even nothing lost in shipping, and purchasing dollar refund issued, that's practically Zero Fee Return, unless you stop ordering from AliExpress, for entire month so will be window of new 30 day period grant for free return new 30 day period, because for any issues you are limited with this 30 day window, not even per calendar month, they cancel free return of shipping charges you forced to pay otherwise if less that 30 day period and they issued to you 3 refund, even if you ordered something and canceled it before being shipped!!! Be Very Careful with anything ordred from Communist country online platform, best case just make sure your sizes are large to fit, your ordered staff is so cheap that worst case scenario you dealing with Credit card issuer for dispute instead of AliExpress, or deemed to accept it as lost!!! 3 maximum orders per any calendar period per month from AliExpress, with 30 day minimum window for return all 3 and use pack them all with order. Otherwise they are Red Commisars Thefts, you sign to dealing with them and their policy GULAG their Communist Manifesto, and they don't care how much of hard worked capitalist dollars you lost, they are happy that you lost, even who is using AliExpress orders are mostly sweat working poor!!! That true for Marxist philosophy, even in business, and if you dealing with Chinese companies just be warned, you loosing money they don't compensate you for dollars spent to parcel shipping to them, zero, their Communist Marxism philosophy prevent them to accept that ANY Customer Is Right, Always and must be left satisfied, without loosing money, but they discreetly hide this \"3 per month return limit\" from your eyes in their AliExpress App Return Policy, this is inside of their own business policy hidden from you misguided you with \"Free Return for 15 day policy on first return\" in their App!!! Instead must be read as no free shipping charge refund if you used already any refund from AliExpress three times in 30 day period!!!\nJust use this as reference of real buyer protection when dealing with Communist country online business orders!!! 3 per month, then if it more your shipping IS NOT FREE for FREE RETURN!!! They forced to refund to credit card purchases from AliExpress, because you can legally dispute them with credit card or bank, but definitely is not fault to dispute with credit card USPS charge for shipping them back, because you paying to USPS, not AliExpress in post office, USPS is not accepted AliExpress coins as legal payment to these deemed for refund shipping back cost!!! When you see credit card statement for these charges merchant is USPS not AliExpress, or any shipping company method if you located outside of US, and in US use still USPS, you paying more with UPS or FedEx, but checking them is free except your lost time heading to post office or UPS or FedEx store with your packages.\nRemember 3 (three) per month!!!\nGlory to Communism, and their GULAG (very sarcastic)!!!!!!!",

It did not even occur to me to plan out a shipping strategy and I am now looking at shipping rates and I don't know how I am going to be able to offer my products without ridiculous shipping charges.\n\nMy product package is a box approximately 12 X 12 X 12. It is not a heavy package but the cheapest rates I could find are close to $20.00 which is just too much and I can't see someone wanting to pay that much for shipping. \n\nFor you guys with successful ecommerce websites, how are you able to offer competitive shipping rates? I'm located in Canada as well, if that's significant at all. Thanks guys.",

In the U.S., you generally are going to go with UPS or FedEx Ground for heavier packages and US Mail for lighter packages.  Special exceptions: preprinted media send US Mail Media Rate; certain things fit into US Mail Priority Flat Rate boxes (they have more sizes if you order off the site than you will get in local post office) and ship more cost-effectively that way.\n\nFor UPS and FedEx, there's a substantial price difference between using a pack and ship corner store or doing daily pickup.  The account costs a minimal amount per week, but the savings far outweigh any weekly costs if you're shipping even small volumes.\n\nI know that's not a complete answer, but I don't know Canada Post rates as well.  These guidelines may help a bit.  I hope so.",

You are right that it's for occasional parcels but it would hardly be profitable for more.\n\nDid you already considered outsourcing part of the logistic to a 3PL concerning your USA orders? Have a look at ShipBob (I'll personally use them fairly soon) \n\nYou have two options I guess :\n- Keep doing the USA/CA orders yourself + Work with a 3PL for your EU/UK sales \n- Start working with a 3PL for USA/CA + EU/UK so they can even balance your inventory between each regions\n\nJust be careful with 3PL as some base costs related to storage are per SKU so if you have 10 designs x 5 sizes it can adds up quite fast so do your computation after you have a speech from the sales rep.\n\nYou might consider serving a smaller part of your inventory via a 3PL in EU for example to decrease base fees.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions \ud83d\ude4f  Wishing you the best \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",

These platforms can assist in selecting the most cost-effective options for each shipment, automate essential tasks like generating labels and commercial invoices, and streamline your entire shipping process.\n\nReduce shipping costs by optimizing your packaging strategy. Utilize lightweight materials and ensure your boxes are appropriately sized to minimize wasted space. Additionally, consider using carrier-provided boxes, as they are often designed for efficiency.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can efficiently scale your international shipping operations, maintain control over costs, and enhance the overall customer experience.",

There are better ways to handle this other than blindly shipping out more product and eating the costs (as many others here are strongly recommending to OP). Yes, retaining your customer is priority. That is why you should establish a rapport with them by recommending they follow up with the carrier (and the police, if they think it was a theft). If they are willing to open a dialogue and consider trying those two solutions, then they are obviously being honest with you. You should definitely be concerned about the issue and try to help them through it. At the end of it all use your best judgement and send them a new product or store credit if the situation calls for it",

Usually on an order of like $100+ it\u2019s about $2-$3, I recommend it. Idk the full logistics but I\u2019m sure they work with a company that will pay out your loss if a customer claims their package was stolen/lost. Or at the very least do the investigation for you. \n\nIf they choose not to get the insurance you can always have a pop up statement or a checkbox confirming that you are not liable for any lost or stolen packages since they opted out of insurance. \n\nI\u2019m glad the situation worked itself out though.

        "content": "Just giving an FYI to anyone who orders from Anthropologie/Urban Outfitters/Free People - if your packages gets stolen, the company WILL NOT refund you. I had my package delivered at 11:30 pm at night through Ontrac shipping and it got stolen by someone following the delivery truck immediately after. It took me 6 calls to finally get refunded and speak with a manager. Each person told me to file a police report and file a claim with my home insurance company (my deductible is more than the package). I have a video of the broke ass bitch who stole it and even offered it as proof. The manager I finally spoke with said they would refund me as a one time courtesy bc the package was delivered so late at night.\n\nI tried placing an order yesterday and it got automatically cancelled. It took 3 calls to get the correct number to speak with someone who knew why my order got cancelled. According to customer service, it was cancelled bc of the charge back of the order that was STOLEN and my account was out on some hold list where I can\u2019t buy anything online. I have to call back on Monday to speak to another person to get my account off hold. \n\nMy issues is why would we pay for an order that was stolen when these companies make millions of dollars off of the backs of consumers.",

If you admit that your parcel was stolen, they won\u2019t replace it - their responsibility is to get your items to your door, they are not responsible if someone doesn\u2019t bring their package in fast enough or if someone lives in a high traffic, high theft area and still chooses to ship their products to their home instead of a more secure location like a local post office (not saying that\u2019s what happened here but that\u2019s how a company sees it).\n\nOnce a known theft happens, it\u2019s also standard practice to ban that shipping address. Why would a company ship product to a location they now know isn\u2019t secure?\n\nI worked in E-commerce customer service for years and truthfully, my coworkers and I didn\u2019t actually care whether or not we replaced a parcel - no skin off our back to process a replacement - but  if the customer openly admitted it was theft in an email or on the phone we were unfortunately bound by policy and would have follow orders to not replace.\n\nYour best bet is to lie next time this happens. Lie to any company you order from because they\u2019ll all have similar policies. Never ever admit it was stolen. Just say I didn\u2019t get my parcel. I was home all day too. No knock, didn\u2019t see the truck.",

        "content": "Don't know if this has been addressed in a thread before, but has anyone had delivered items stolen and what did you do?\n\nBetween work and being caregivers for family, we are frequently not home when orders are delivered and it has not been an issue till now. I received a delivery email today while out that showed the items on our front steps. Lo and beyond when we finally got home hours later, no box was to be found anywhere, so it was obvious some POS porch pirate got to it first.\n\nWhile normally I would be somewhat pissed, the fact this was both much anticipated items and a whole five of them in the same box, makes me quintuple pissed. Add to the fact one of them had an ETV of $110 I am now on the hook for.\n\nSince there is a record of it being delivered, I'm imagining I don't have the option of contacting Vine CS and trying to get them all taken off since they can say I received them even if I technically didn't. Yet now I not only have the tax hit on the one but can't do reviews on all five and it's going to affect my stats. \n\nI'm not sure what the hell I can or should do as it seems like there is not the same protections for Vine missing items as there is for regular Amazon and I fear it will be chalked up to that's just life when you live in a neighborhood of thieving scumbags.\n\nI do want to make clear I am not seeking comments or advice on what I should have done or what I should do in the future about keeping packages safe (getting a PO Box, Amazon locker, etc.), since I'm almost certain that will be some responses, but I just seek advice on what my immediate recourse, if any is.\n\n",

Packages have \"PLEASE USE LOCKBOX CODE xxxx #\" as the second line.\n\nNow, 95%-ish of the time, the delivery person (Amazon, UPS, FedEx etc.) will place the package in the box.  Default instructions for Amazon tell them to put it in the lock box. Amazon wants them to put them in the lock box. It takes 2nds.\n\nOccassionally a lazy or oblivious drive will put the package RIGHT next to or in front of the BIG METAL GRAY LOCK BOX, take a picture of it and leave.  Then, they get Amazon all over them.  I chat Amazon, ask them to look at my shipping label, my instructions and the picture and f they notice anything just not right.  Used to be they would give me a $5 credit but I never ask nor expect it.\n\nIt seems to happen when I leave town of course..\n\nThe lock box is easier than the garage door method... but theft is common in our area as our development is just off two major streets and across from a big park that enables unhoused to accumulate their stuff...\n\nI paid a mere $30 for the box at Costco.

                "content": "Appreciate the advice so far. As far as choosing to contact Vine CS anyway, I imagine I should do so with each item individually and not all five at once? I know many others here have said that Vine CS doesn't do nuance and can only handle one issue at a time, but I am also worried if I get them to write off that many, they will hold it against me somehow and maybe think I'm lying just to get out of reviewing things. But that's just too many items to keep hanging in \"pending review\" that will never be reviewed and I won't have a sufficient buffer come my next eval.\n\nIt just pisses me off the more I think about it as it is not only being on the hook for the $110 ETV on the one, but the other four, even though they were 0 ETV, were all unicorn items (two that were well-known name brands) that I rarely see, was in the right place at the right time to snag them and will likely never get another chance again. Out of all the items someone had to steal, it had to be these five! It couldn't have been some lousy questionable supplement, but five of the most coveted items I was lucky to snatch up and Amazon just had to send all together at once. Some scumbag really hit the motherlode.\n\nIf this was regular Amazon, I would apparently have the option of contacting the seller and maybe getting a replacement, but not so with Vine. So, while I may (or may not) be able to get the tax and my obligation to review taken off, but I will still never get five things I really wanted. Never have I wished someone to rot in hell more so than today.",

If this seems like a lot to someone, they should get their butt up and head on down to the Food N Stuff. As for people who are elderly and disabled, we should be supporting them in a way that is NOT instacart. That\u2019s another can of worms. So\u2026sympathy? No. This is a luxury privilege of a service. Honestly, you think you should be able to hire a live human being for less than the sum of those menial fees? Get the fuck out of here!",

        "content": "This question/post is kind of in jest, but at the same time, it's not.  I live in a southern California mountain community, and we get snow 5 to 10 times a year between late fall and late spring. Whenever there's a hint of snow, or any kind of weather really, FedEx will not make it up here, and it sets off a chain reaction where my package will usually arrive at least a week later (usually from Bloomington). \n\nToday however, we had 3 to 4 inches of snow on the ground, and UPS still made it up to bring me a replacement credit card that was sent to me. Last week, we had a very icy mountain highway, chains required, cars slipping and sliding everywhere, and I still saw UPS chugging along, finally making it down the hill around 8pm.\n\nThey never seem to be phased by the weather and are always up here happy as can be. It's the exception for UPS to miss a delivery, where with FedEx it's the rule. \n\nAny idea why UPS is better equipped to handle weather as compared to FedEx?",

But usually that someone, trains another to run the route for them and takes a cut off of it.

Just the fact that a company could promise your package to you in 2-5 business days from a different county across the world is still pretty impressive by me and I\u2019ve been with them for 5 years and we keep adding flights to different destinations to get faster delivery times.",

Instead of telling me my stuff (that I need for my job) will be here December 3rd, maybe tell me between the 3-6 with a footnote about how it\u2019s the holidays, or something. Honestly ANYTHING. I get you\u2019re people, just like me, but without anything to tell my boss I may get the boot, and why should I or anyone empathize with your brand then? Downvote me all you want, and don\u2019t bother to have a proper discussion. FedEx seems good at hiding shit. \nSincerely , an even more frustrated customer.",

I asked if it was new and apparently it's been there for about a year. I just wanted to vent and point out that me paying this man who is paid by FedEx to help me for 5 minutes is insane. I'll just buy transparency paper and take it to staples..",

If FedEx doesn't know and needs to me to be home the entire day to sign for a package, just say so. Instead, FedEx gives me window making believe I can come home during that window and be fine. I have gotten regular FedEx deliveries over the past 6 months, at least 2 to 3 per month and I have yet to have one delivered during the estimated delivery window. \n\nI just had another package miss its time window. It was quoted at between 9:30am to 1:30pm.  By 10am it still was \"on the way\" instead of \"out for delivery\" so I figured it was delayed as my local FedEx loads their trucks at around 7:30am consistently, so I went to work. At 4:40pm I get a noticed from my doorbell camera that the FedEx driver was there.",

Or will it just be confiscated rather than the customer notified of where and how to get their package?\n\n2. Are international customers expecting that customs traps the shipment, and they will then have to pay more?\n\n3. Finally, international shipping according to Shopify's shipping calculator seems pretty expensive compared to my limited experience of buying things from outside the US. Will some third party shipping manager (like Shipstation) find a better price?\n\nThanks for any insight.",

                "content": "1. Customs varies depending on the receiving country. Typically there is a \"de minimis\" which means minimum amount they will charge tax/duty over. Some countries are very low, or non existent, ie Canada charges taxes on parcels over $40. USA is $800\n2. Yes. If delivered by UPS the package is often delivered with a bill, or the customer receives a bill later in the mail. By postal mail it varies but usually I have to pay at the post office to receive. I make my international shipping quite clear that it does not include import rax/duty and is \"buyer beware\". You can ship DDP - this is where you the shiiper pay the duty and taxes instead, but that's its own can of worms. it is a much better experience for the buyer but if you do not charge the tax at the point of sale you lose that money, and you need to know what the duty rates for your products are\n3. Yes, my negotiated UPS rates for example are lower than what shopify calculates, there are other e-parcel type services that offer slow post for much cheaper than even usps\n\nI recommend some youtube courses on this stuff, as it can get complicated, for example i have had a customer reject a package and the return postage was higher than the order value, so according to my TOS I did not refund it and let the postal service dispose of the order. It fucking sucked but that was on him, like I said I am very clear at check out that it does not include these charges, and I even send a follow up email to let them know before shipping",

                "content": "Here are some key points to consider:\n\n\\- Each country has its own customs regulations and import duty thresholds known as the \"de minimis\" value. It's crucial to research and be aware of these regulations in the countries you plan to ship to.  \n\\- International customers expect potential customs duties or taxes, especially if the order exceeds their country's de minimis value. Clearly communicate this on your website and during checkout.  \n\\- Your choice of shipping carrier matters. Some private carriers charge very high, while postal carriers can offer a smoother experience, particularly for lower-value packages.   \n\\- Shopify's shipping calculator provides estimates but may not always reflect the best rates. Many carriers offer shipping discounts, even for smaller shipment volumes, such as 50 or 5000 per month. It's wise to explore alternative shipping options to secure more competitive rates.  \n\\- Think about offering a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) option, where you cover import duties and taxes for your customers. This can improve the customer experience, but pricing and potential losses due to high duty rates should be carefully considered.  \n\n\nConsider using an app that automates your shipping process, offering features such as live rate calculations at checkout, label printing, commercial invoices, various packing methods, rate optimization, order tracking, and more. This can save you both time and money",

It was a mess.\n\nAnyways, trying to save myself and also ship orders internationally, but doing some quotes I\u2019m blown away.\n\nSo to my knowledge, as a business you will want to have the duties and taxes paid for beforehand, that way the customer can just receiver can just receive the item no hassle.\n\nHowever, doing this, you\u2019re talking at LEAST $60 shipping charges (from US to Canada), and thats for a 4x6in package thats .5in in thickness.\n\nIs this correct or am I doing something wrong? Is it seriously 60+ dollars to internationally ship something through DHL? (It says 100+ through UPS).\n\nIf I don\u2019t pay duties and taxes, it\u2019s something like $20, but to my knowledge, you want to have the customer pay this beforehand, right? \n\nAppreciate any help",

Sometimes USPS sneaks through without it for whatever reason but the other two do it every time. It varies on whether or not the customers understand this. Many know that ordering from the USA this is part of a deal. Despite big bold warnings on our checkout page, others still get confused and leave us bad reviews s cause they don't understand why they're being charged another $20 to receive their tshirt.",

Do you pay customs or do you let the customer pay it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I would like is offering international shipping, declare value, set HS code, and have the option to either pay customs or pass the customs duty along to the customer.

Another nice thing about online postage is free e-delcon, which is essentially free tracking in the US, and some other countries, as well as, electronic customs forms. \n\nPlease don't waste your time standing in line at the post office to ship a package. There is no need to. If you need to weigh your package, most POs have a free scale to use, or get creative. Small packages can be weighed on a kitchen scale. If you are regular reddit gifter, I recommend going on ebay and purchasing a small postal scale. It will run you $10-15, shipping included. It will be money well spent.\n\nSo after you have weighed your package and went online to buy your postage, and print out your label, and attached it, comes the last no stress part. Getting it to the post office. The super lazy way is to go online or call and schedule a pick up (no charge.) A mail carrier will come to your house or business and fetch it for you. For free. Or you can go to any post office branch at any hour day or nite (3am is my usual drop off time) and  drop your package in the package drop. Most people assume when the post office is done doing business for the day, they lock the doors. So not true.\n\nI try not go to the post office during normal hours, because seeing all the clueless, helpless people puts me on tilt. I then spend an hour helping them get their packages ready for shipping and educating them about online postage. \n\nIf you have any other questions regarding shipping, packaging, shipping times etc, please ask. I will be more than happy to assist you.\n\nSource: I am a small online retailer and I ship worldwide every day.  ",

With USPS, the biggest issues stem from people not getting an actual acceptance scan when they drop off their packages.  \n\nI think the main factor in your choice should be based on what you're selling.  If you're selling something small and lightweight, it doesn't make much sense to use anything other than USPS.  If you're selling something large and heavy, you shouldn't use USPS as it will be much more expensive.  \n\nUSPS is most convenient for me as I mail mostly first class eligible stuff, and I mail right from home without ever going to a post office.  That's a free service from USPS, with the other carriers I have to go drop packages off.  I really haven't had significant issues with USPS ever.  It can depend on where you live (some regional USPS facilities just happen to be bad) but I think the claims of how horrible USPS is overall are massively exaggerated.  \n\nStarting August 1st, Etsy will be covering all lost packages for both sellers and buyers, as well as 1 damaged package per year.  I would say that should negate the need for insurance for most people.  \n\nAll the carriers do come with the same $100 included insurance, except for USPS first class or parcel select (don't use parcel select).  I have heard it is super difficult to get UPS to pay out.  Not sure about FedEx.  I haven't had issues getting USPS to pay but you need to have photos of a damaged box (that's true of all insurance, though).",

It takes less than a week to deliver in the US for about $9-11 CAD. Next day shipping is $20-25 and they always get delivered in time. I used to ship with CanadaPost but I've had some packages held up at the customs for 2-3 weeks and it honestly stresses me out a lot when that happens so I switched. I do custom pet portrait commissions so replacing a lost/misdelivered product is doable but too much work. I use CanadaPost for regular untracked snail mail/lettermail and I haven't had any missing mail so far. April/May was really slow for lettermail though but I think they are back to their regular delivery times.\n\nIt does get expensive within Canada especially for places that are outside UPS's route so I use CanadaPost Expedited Shipping if UPS/NetParcel is quoting me more than $15.",

The website and app stay synced, so I can pick up my pone once a day, and see with one quick glance if anything has been delayed.\n\nWhat I do like about it is that it supports so many carriers, it will automatically detect the carrier, and then all stays in sync with the app on my phone.\n\nWhat I don't like about it is that there is no integration for Pirate Ship, eBay, WooCommerce etc. I have to manually add each tracking number as I ship orders, it would be nice if I could just import the shipment info directly from Pirate Ship. It only takes a few seconds to copy/paste the info, but it's an added step that I would like skip.",

Most of the time, I use apps or websites like 17track or ParcelsApp, which aggregate tracking information from multiple carriers, making monitoring all my shipments in one place easy. However, I've been exploring [parcel management software](https://www.parceltracker.com/parcel-management-software) for a more organized approach. This type of software offers a more streamlined experience, especially when dealing with multiple shipments simultaneously. It allows me to centralize all my package data, set up automatic alerts, and even analyze delivery performance over time, making managing parcels more efficient and less stressful.",

We are usually shipping full container loads, so this will mostly apply to that.\n\n# For the most part, I have found freight forwarders to be pretty passive.  They will not work that hard to find you the most efficient routing and get your shipment delivered the quickest.  They will not push to have your shipment picked up and delivered in the timeliest manner.  In many cases this will work to their advantage due to increased upcharges - pre-pull, chassis, storage, etc.  They will often blame delays on shipment caused by their own lack of attention to detail on someone else and due to the opaqueness in shipping, the customer is none the wiser.  Use these resources to be on top of the shipments yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Linescape](https://www.linescape.com/) \\- We use this to find ships and routings to find the most efficient and direct route between two ports.  Plug in the origination and destination ports and the date window, and it will show you all sailing scheduled between those two ports and how long each takes.  \n\n[https://www.track-trace.com/](https://www.track-trace.com/) \\- Easy way to quickly track a shipment by container or bill of lading.  Just plug in the container or b/l and it will route you to the tracking page on the correct carrier's site.\n\n[Crux Systems](https://cruxsystems.com/) \\- Crux Systems lets you save a list of containers to a dashboard and it will continuously update their status.  Shows you when they leave port, estimated arrival date, when the container is discharged.  Displays all container holds and reason for the holds.  When the container was picked up, etc.  We use this as well to audit the forwarders and their upcharges.  On more than one occasion we've gotten charged removed because they have stated misstated when a container was picked up.\n\n[Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/) \\- Let's you track the location of a ship.  Right now you'll see that many ships are anchored off the coast waiting to come in to dock.  This is especially bad in LA/Long Beach where we are seeing delays of approximately a week while ships anchor off port due to congestion.",

Use these resources to be on top of the shipments yourself.\n\nFYI, that\u2019s not the forwarder doing that to you unless your forwarder is also your carrier. That\u2019s the carriers and the ports. We make NOTHING on those increased up charges you mentioned and those other things you mentioned are out of our control or are done because of things out of our control. Trust me, we hate it too since we get the blame from the customer. A good forwarder will articulate these things to you however, and will explain what and why.\n\nSource: am forwarder.",

Most of the time the shipments are on time and once they're on the ship there's not much I can do. The worst part of shipping to the US is the customs searches. It appears to be at random and worse when you do LCL because someone else might have a red flag. I've had shipments held up for a month because it was flagged for a customs search and there was a line for it. And I think the most important thing for avoiding a customs search is getting the HS code correct. I think some months back someone else posted links for tracking ships. It's best that your company has a different name from your product/trademark names so your competitors can't look for you. Make it something generic like Lincoln Trading or ACME.",

A good starting point would be to contact the vendor you use for regulated waste and ask them for a quote to package and ship the chemicals to their destination. Concurrently, see how much it would be to order the chemicals from the favored supply house. Check with your institution and see if they charge back the lab for disposal, and include this information as well. That way your boss can make an informed decision about which viable solution is the cheapest. If they want to see what it would take for you to do it, take a look at the cost and timeline of your country's dangerous goods shipping training and possibly ask your institution's ehs group for advice. \n\nTBH, I know the waste vendor may not be the least expensive, but it's usually a company that already has a relationship with the institution so it can be easier than getting a purchase order or contract approved.",

        "title": "Employer forcing me to ship hazmat without a hazmat certification.",
        "content": "Title says it all. I'm a warehouse employee for a company that has me shipping and receiving cargo all day. Today I was told to ship two cylinders of flammable gas, UN3161, as general cargo. I know enough about hazmat to know that I probably shouldn't be doing that, and the MSDS it came with says cargo aircraft only and limited quantity forbidden. Nonetheless, I was ordered to pack both in the same box and ship via FedEx. If there's a problem during transit, would I be found liable for anything? Is this something where I should consider working elsewhere?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: The shipment we sent to FedEx was rejected and returned to our warehouse. I have given my two weeks notice to the office manager, showed her the printout from the 49 CFR for penalties, and explained that I will not send out any hazmat. While she understood and was sympathetic, the boss who ordered me to ship out the hazmat the day before was furious and we got into a ten minute argument. He is saying that I was never ordered to ship out any hazmat to the point where I'm feeling gaslighted. \n\nThe day we sent out that hazmat I was adamantly against it for hours, explaining that we cannot do this because nobody is hazmat certified. He then called his boss who told him that we can send out hazmat without certification as long as we're using the customers FedEx account in the payment section. I explained for 10 minutes how we would still be considered the packer and the shipper. He then later came back and showed me a text he got from a worker in another company that said if the box was marked hazardous then it would be fine, that I could call that person to double check. I asked if that person was hazmat certified, my boss said he didn't know but he wanted closure with this today, that customers needed it (at the time it was one bottle of PT-14 to destination A) and we had to ship it out today. So I reluctantly (and still regret it) packaged as best as I could, labeled as hazmat as obviously as I could for FedEx (made sure there was a cargo aircraft only label printed out and taped on the box), and then used the FedEx shipper program to send as general cargo because I don't know how to do the hazmat section ... at which point they added another bottle of PT-14 in the same box and changed the destination to \"destination B\". Because our FedEx driver had already picked up earlier, that boss had to physically take the box to a nearby FedEx facility himself. He knew that the label was done as general cargo because we can't do hazmat on the FedEx shipper, that it was hazmat and likely to be rejected, and that I did not feel comfortable with sending it.\n\nSo now after I gave my two weeks he argued with me that I was never under pressure to send it out, that I was never ordered to send it out, that I should have called and spoke with that person from another company to ask him how to ship it out, and that I should have arranged a hotshot driver to pick up the cargo and drive it to the destination (we would still need to package it). \n\nI suppose it doesn't matter now because I've given my two weeks and stated that I will not handle any hazmat while I'm there.",

Upper management still wants to just ship the item without any labels and employee certs since it increases costs and they think it's a waste of money, but I've been able to put a stop to that for the most part.\n\nAs for fines, yes they can potentially fine you or take you to jail (if there was a large incident due to not following the rules) as the actual shipper (the person who signs the shipping papers for ground or DGD for air). But typically they do a bit of digging to find out who is ultimately responsible for shipping that item incorrectly or see if the business should be fined. You will most likely be fine if you can prove that someone above you commanded you to do it.\n\n[Here's a fine they charged to a business when it got bad.](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-11-million-civil-penalty-against-braille-battery-inc-alleged-hazmat) I'll add that lithium batteries are one of the most commonly shipped hazmat items since they are in a bunch of consumer electronics (cellphones, laptops, etc.) and other stuff.\n\nIf you specify ground or air, I can give you the sections that call out the penalties.\n\nAs for contacting someone, I have a direct contact for someone at DOT that does go to businesses to check on incidents, but it's not as easy to get someone out when a large incident hasn't occurred yet. They work regionally, so I may be able to get the contact for the person who would cover your company's location.\n\nIIRC, there may be something in the 49 CFR that mentions you can take instructions from someone else who is certified while you're not certified, but I believe that's if you're still new to the company. I can't remember what it said exactly. Doesn't seem to be your situation though.",

If they finally get caught, it's about $20k+ for shipping a hazmat item unmarked. Plus other related fines.",

They will exactly say..i did not tell him or did not force him. You will get in trouble by the company. Ive got in trouble before. It is why i am telling you this.  Fk them. Dont break the law and report them if they try to act stupid. They can drive it themselves or ship it themselves.  The problem that people like you who feel pressured go along with it. We must all unite to put a strict statement and protect our right. And if they try to be all buddy buddy, dont allow it. They try to do favors to u because then you will feel pressured not to say no when they make u do something illegal. Also you will get an expensive ticket.

        "title": "LPT: Safely package fragile items for shipping/transport",
        "content": "I work for a major shipping company. This practical advice is preparatory to the craziest part of my working year. It derives from four years of experience and a so-far perfect track record of no damages.\n\n1. Do not choose your box first. Safely wrap the fragile item in bubble wrap first, securing it around all edges, and only then can you get an accurate idea of the box you need. If you do it the other way around you will under-protect your item.\n\n2. If it's dishes, glass, or electronics, you want not to be able to see the color of the item through the bubble wrap- figure a minimum of two inches on each surface.\n\n3. If possible, extremely fragile stuff is best double-boxed.\n\n4. You do not want to hear any rattling or feel the contents shift. Wrap in bubble first, then nest it in an immobilizing layer of crumpled paper- newspaper is great for this.\n\n5. Packing peanuts are the ENEMY. They break down during transit as they jostle. Their usefulness is directly linked to how efficiently they take up space to immobilize your stuff. When they break down, they settle and do not protect properly.\n\n6. Single-corrugated boxes like shoeboxes or the ones large items come in from big-box stores are NOT, repeat NOT made for shipping. Companies that send you stuff this way are taking a gamble. Don't make that mistake with Grandma's Glass McGuffin.\n\n7. DO NOT weave the box lids together, half of one flap up and half down, as some people like to do. This is actually less secure. Simply close the box the way it normally wants to go and tape it in an H shape- one down the middle and one across each open side. Trust me. I know it looks like not much but it really works better.\n\n8. Is your package over thirty pounds? Get a really nice box. Like, a double-corrugated one. It'll be super thick and heavy but you will thank me for it later.\n\n9. Wondering if your box is packed up well enough? Imagine it falling from about the height of your waist. Now your shoulder. Most commercial shipping conveyors are about that high up. Now imagine it landing on edge. On corner. Does it survive? How about if the professional athlete of your choice gives it a good kicking? Those are my litmus tests.\n\nIf it's liquid, double-bag it. If it's a musical instrument, be sensible and put it in a hard case... But first, loosen the strings. If it's fragile- here's the weird one- DON'T put fragile stickers on. Doesn't matter who you ship with, the guys in blue brown OR purple; every company has a few bad apples and while they do tend to get fired right quickly, a FRAGILE sticker is like an unholy beacon to that kind of person. \n\nPlan ahead. Don't wait until the afternoon before it has to be delivered.\n\nThat's what I've got for now.",

                "content": "I do a lot of shipping. You'll want to pad the item itself - bubble wrap, thin foam, an article of clothing, whatever you have really.  If it's flat glass, like a picture frame, I would recommend putting it between two sheets of cardboard and plastic wrapping it before wrapping it in padding. You can even pad your item, then put it in a small box that goes inside your shipping box.\n\nOnce you've done that, you'll want to find a way to put it in the box making sure it's not actually touching the box in any place. You basically want it to be floating within the box. Use those air bubbles, wads of bubble wrap, packing peanuts, pretty much anything lightweight that will put a couple inches of space between your item and the box. Tape the box well.",

        "title": "Postage Expectations: When People Say A Month Is Too Long For Delivery.",
        "content": "Hello all! I wanted to touch on expectations of estimated delivery times. I'm not talking about sellers not posting on time, deliberately misleading listings or dropshipping. I think that many people forget that we don't all share the same network of delivery because things are made more convenient by Amazon, etc.\n\n1.5 weeks ago, I had made a post about a customer wanting to cancel an order 2 weeks after it was posted as 'It wouldn't get here for Christmas'. They'd purchased November 21st & I posted it earlier than my dispatch time (Dec 1st). My delivery profile is est. up to 35 days (est. arrival Dec 29-Jan 9th). Some were shocked despite it being an international order during Christmas. Unfortunately, I've seen replies here saying, 2-3 weeks isn't acceptable.\n\nIt's important to understand that not every country has the same infrastructure especially depending on the country's wealth and seasons. For e.g. Royal Mail takes 3-7 days v.s. Bulgarian Post 2 weeks - 1 month. When I send Christmas cards home to Jamaica, we do it early October as the postal infrastructure is hit and miss. During the Ukrainian war, I often saw people complaining that packages not arriving and no response from sellers. From sellers in a literal warzone. Obviously there were many scammers but many people couldn't grasp the situation.\n\nDelivery companies may consider a package lost ranging from 24hours (UPS) to 24 days (Royal Mail) past expected delivery. Then the parcel search may take an extra 10 days. I'm usually in delivery companies forums the mess ups and bts. I had a package that got posted from the UK to the US but sent to Japan. I do agree that some compensation should be given especially too late. Obviously the Etsy guarantee program helps but then you come across buyers who don't want to take your advice and open a case. What do you do then? Again, I see many replies to eat the cost and time to avoid bad reviews. Etsy sellers are not big corporations without families or tuition fees to be paid. There are some shops who do earn \u00a345,000 a year but many don't. I think a lot of replies saying this down more harm then good creating negative reinforcement on either sides.\n\nSometimes people have to curb their expectations especially during Christmas when it's something out of the sellers control and they've done everything right. Ordering 2 weeks before Christmas is not guaranteed even if you're in the same country. Currently in the UK people have been saying that royal mail only delivers once a week despite purchasing 1st class shipping. People are in fear that they medication or court documents aren't arriving. I empathize a lot as I was also on edge waiting for my passport to head back to uni but please remember that real people exist behind the businesses too.\n\nEveryone should be reading listings double checking what they've ordered  and ordering early to avoid disappointment. If you make a mistake cancel early and buy something local. If someone giving a run around or too delayed past delivery time, open a case to get your money back. Message take away, everyone should be responsible for their expectations and be open minded within reason. Thank you for your time.\n\nP.s. I'm a Seller & Buyer From over yonder so I've lived multiple lives \ud83d\udc40.",

The item was marked delivered so I didn't realize until the buyer messaged me after a month asking about it... and I found out it went to a completely different city. Then, trying to get Canada Post to acknowledge this error was a nightmare. I ended up re-shipping to the customer, filing a claim with CP and it took about 10 months for them to pay me for it. Oh... the best part.  They re-delivered the original item twice afterwards to who knows where before actually getting it to the customer... three months after shipping. \n\nIf domestic can be this nuts... international can be even crazier.",

Are their expectations actually unreasonable in the modern retail landscape? We can rage against amazon all we like but it doesn't change the fact that the e-retail landscape is now as much about speed as it is about price. \n\nI know we all want to make our customers happy, but as sellers we are more aware than they are that international shipping can sometimes throw up curveballs and it is up to us to manage that, not just push blame back to the customer. It's frustrating when things go awry, for them as well as us. \n\nI wonder perhaps if it might be helpful to brainstorm ways to make the experience smoother for everyone on this thread, rather than turning into a rant about customers? \n\nFor example- \n\n\u2022 How do other sellers effectively manage expectations,\u00a0especially around Christmas processing cut-off dates?\u00a0 \n\n\u2022 Shipping options exploration:\u00a0What are your experiences with different carriers and services? Is tracked shipping a must for international orders? How do you build those costs in? \n\n\u2022 How do you handle challenging customer interactions?\u00a0What strategies have worked well for you in communicating with worried buyers when parcels are delayed? \n\nI'm bet we can learn a lot from each other!",

Anything from your experience (positive or negative), questions regarding delivery wait times or delivery issues, and delivery damage images all belong in this megathread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Who will ship my Steam Deck?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn North America (US/CA), this will be \\[FedEx\\]([https://www.fedex.com/en-us/tracking.html](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/tracking.html)). RMA's are also processed by \\[FedEx\\]([https://www.fedex.com/en-us/tracking.html](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/tracking.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Europe, this will be \\[GLS\\]([https://gls-group.eu/EU/en/parcel-tracking](https://gls-group.eu/EU/en/parcel-tracking)). In the UK, this will be \\[ParcelForce\\]([https://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace](https://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace)) or \\[EVRI\\]([https://www.evri.com/](https://www.evri.com/)) (formerly known as Hermes), usually in times of industrial action. RMA's in Europe are by \\[DHL\\]([https://www.dhl.com/global-en/home/tracking.html](https://www.dhl.com/global-en/home/tracking.html)).\n\n~~In Komodo regions we aren't sure yet. It will almost certainly be a large, local courier service. Regardless of who ships it, you will receive a tracking number to follow your Deck's progress.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Update for December 2022 via Valve:* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Starting December 1st, customers in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and  Taiwan who have already reserved their Steam Deck will receive email  confirmations to finalize their orders. These orders will start shipping  on December 17th.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"We're happy to announce that Steam Decks will start shipping in Japan,  South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on December 17th via Komodo, our  official Steam Deck distributor in these regions.  Customers in these regions can reserve the Steam Deck here:* [*steamdeck.komodo.jp*](https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/)*\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://nitter.net/OnDeck/status/1597776258414542849](https://nitter.net/OnDeck/status/1597776258414542849)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I'm stuck on 'Shipping Soon!', help!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's normal for your order to stay on 'Shipping Soon' for several days. We usually see Steam Deck's delivered within 6-8 working days after placing the order. A business day is considered Mon-Fri.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it has been longer than 8 working days and it's still on 'Shipping Soon', you should contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)) for assistance. If you have tracking but are past 8 working days, you should await your Steam Deck for longer, unless it has been 5 working days since your last tracking update, in which case you should contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***My tracking says pre-advice / awaiting parcel, help!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a normal step in the process, this means your parcel is somewhere between Valve's warehouse and your delivery providers first sorting hub. Parcels are not scanned until they reach this hub, and therefore it can show as pre-advice / awaiting parcel even if they do currently have the parcel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis usually changes within 1 working day, though don't be alarmed as it can take up to 3 working days (working days, Mon-Fri). If it's been longer than that, you should contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Do FedEx/GLS/ParcelForce deliver on Sundays?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[FedEx delivers to \\\\\\~80% of the US population on a Sunday.\\]([https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/saturday-and-sunday-delivery.html#Sunday](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/saturday-and-sunday-delivery.html#Sunday))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Europe, as with most delivery companies, GLS (& ParcelForce) does not typically deliver on a Sunday. They may do so in times of peak demand (around Christmas), but outside of this it's unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth FedEx and GLS do deliver on Saturdays though!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(UK) My parcel is stuck in customs, what do I do?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis can happen in both the RMA and delivery process, but this will usually be sorted and cleared through customs after a short delay. In uncommon cases, it may take longer (on a scale of working days), but will still clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, if at any point the tracking says that additional information is required, please contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(UK) My parcel hasn't updated from the Netherlands in several days, should I be concerned?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, you should not be concerned. This is because there is no tracking update between it leaving the Netherlands Hub, and it arriving in the UK for customs checks. Depending on several events outside of the control of GLS/ParcelForce, there are many different reasons why this could take a long period of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***My Steam Deck is delayed, I'm annoyed!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to hear that your Steam Deck has been delayed. Unfortunately, as with any delivery service, it's possible for issues and delays to occur during the delivery process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo long as your shipping provider is giving you frequent updates, and has not elapsed more than 5 working days without an update, hang tight!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you haven't received an update in over 5 working days (Mon-Fri), please contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***My Steam Deck is broken/stolen/lost from delivery, help!***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should contact \\[Steam Support\\]([https://help.steampowered.com/en/](https://help.steampowered.com/en/)) as soon as possible so that a replacement can be arranged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/",

I\u2019ve read about this happening to other people too, the box was even resealed and they even took the charging adapter. I don\u2019t think this is porch pirating cuz they would\u2019ve taken the box and the Steam Dock (shipped separately) was untampered. My father and I are pretty certain this was stolen at a FedEx facility. I\u2019ve filed a claim with steam and FedEx, but is that enough? I unfortunately don\u2019t have a video of me opening it, only a video after. And the shipping weight says 4 lbs even though there\u2019s no way that can be true, which really worries me. Am I covered? Will steam believe me? Is there any more I can do besides wait? I\u2019m really worried cuz I\u2019m a broke college student and have been saving little by little for a very long time and there\u2019s no way I can buy another one.",

My original steam deck order was marked as delivered by FedEx but I never received it\u2026 may have been stolen from the mail room of my building I have no clue, just know that when I went down to get it, it was not there. Steam determined that the original shipment \u201cwent missing\u201d and decided to ship me a new one to a more secure location, that being my local FedEx print/ ship center\u2026 so the second delivery has been out for delivery since Saturday (now 5 days later) after a lot of back and forth with FedEx they are telling me the case has to be moved over to their security team because they think the package is missing. So now I have currently been shipped TWO steam decks and have received neither. I opened up a second ticket with steam support now but I don\u2019t even know what will happen at this point. Will they even offer to send another after 2 have gone missing because of FedEx incompetence? Can I pay extra to have one shipped a different way\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll offer me a refund at this point but I hope they could at least do that. I\u2019ve already bought a dock and a micro sd memory upgrade for it so I\u2019d really like to get the deck, but I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point",

        "content": "Hello I am 26F inventory manager in our owned business. We have a 3PL Logistics & Warehousing business in India.  We mostly store Plastic Granules  ( LDPE, HDPE, PP , PVC Powder and many more ), they come in thin 25kg bags . Recently manufacturers have sent us multiple debit notes when asked upon they tell us it\u2019s because of multiple bag tear while loading the truck. We tried to get to the bottom of it and realised that the reason for bag tear were the hooks of the truck that are used for tying tarpaulin. This is totally out of our control but what could be the possible ways to minimise these tear? ",
