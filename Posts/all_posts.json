What areas should we focus on? As a Canadian procurement manager, I welcome any insights on the US/Canada supply chain!",

If it's anything like the last time around, expect fire drills to wait for you on a random morning when the USTR drops a new list of HTS codes up for review. If you work for a large global corporation you'll be tasked with the following:¬†\n\n\n1. Identify the impact to your spend--worst case scenario that this will cost is\n2. Work with executives to prepare for lobbying meetings in DC. Some companies got exemptions last time around. It just takes the time, manpower, and money. I moved to a midsize company and they had no idea that was going on.¬†\n3. Work with your Chinese suppliers to shift any remaining spend over to other LCCS countries. Much of that work has already been done but I'm sure there's more we'll have to do there\n4. If they can't shift to another country, ask for cost reductions\n5. Anything that can't be mitigated will be passed along to the consumer via price increases",

I run a trucking company, and we've recently reduced our fleet due to decreased post-COVID demand and fierce competition where everyone is vying for the lowest prices. It feels like a battle of attrition, and I'm curious how other companies are coping. Is it even feasible to operate in this market? How are you handling the situation? Thank you for any insights.",

Ranges from simple intake to actual 4PL models.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. In/out - which should encompass everything as far as offload/reload, getting it to its spot and any sort labeling that they do internally.\n\n2. Storage - self explanatory \n\n3. Order Entry - so this every time an order is sent. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many shipments this results in, there‚Äôs a charge. \n\n4. Pick & Pack - this is if you client has multiple sku‚Äôs and they send you FCLs/FTLs with one sku that eventually need to be broken down to create a pallet with multiple sku‚Äôs on it.\n\n5. Additional material, labor, etc. - this is like pallet charges, wrapping charges, man labor if a container tipped over and you need someone to restack this etc.\n\nIf you do international: customs, ocean/air etc. is next. Then final mile charges. Then if you have a WMS system and they want to be able to login, you‚Äôll need to charge them an integration fee (and bump the order entry fee to make up for all the fees of them inputting loads now)\n\nFor reference, I own 200K sq ft in Miami. We have FTZ space and bonded space, the below is about an avg. charge per the above scope:\n\n1. $20/$20\n2. $35\n3. $22\n4. $0.65\n5. Varies\n\nHope this helps.",

        "content": "In order to make more money in the logistic space generally speaking, you need to move up from the line level into supervision and or leadership roles, or some kind of specialty role, like inventory management or IT. The first step in terms of determining where to go, is to look at your set of skills. What do you enjoy most about the job? What do you consider key strengths of yours? If you have a strong attention detail and are good with numbers inventory or financial analysis would be good places to explore. If you‚Äôre a hard worker, dedicated and can show up every day, have good communication skills then looking to get into a lead role or management role would be something to consider. If you‚Äôre great at written communication, email, problem solving and friendly on the phone. Client services would be something to consider. Once you determine what you think would be the best fit. The next step would be to talk to someone that you get along with on your leadership team. Explain to them that you‚Äôre interested in career progression and you‚Äôre willing to put in the work. Tell them that you think you would be good at whatever mightier might be and ask for their help, in getting some exposure to different opportunities. Some logistics companies have some type of management training programs that you might be able to participate in.  Minimally you could volunteer to assist whoever the lead person might be to start to get a better feel for a particular role so that you can understand if it‚Äôs something you feel would be a good fit. When you can find something that you like, and that you‚Äôre good at then work becomes a lot easier, and your career progression will be faster. All of these will pay you more than 45k a year and as you move up in higher management roles,, you could make 100K or more. Keep in mind that the trade-off for more money is always harder work in many cases longer hours and in almost all cases higher levels of responsibility that come with more pressure. That‚Äôs just the trade-off in this business for higher wages.",

For immediate action, organizations deploy adaptive traffic signals, reroute traffic, and use live updates for drivers. Advanced technologies like AI-driven traffic cameras can detect bottlenecks and adjust traffic light patterns in real time. Long-term solutions include building alternate routes, improving public transit, and promoting staggered work hours to reduce peak traffic. Some cities also use congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter high-traffic zones. A mix of these strategies has proven effective in minimizing gridlock and keeping traffic flowing.",

This situation is exacerbating the industry's struggles with rising costs and a vessel shortage. Sea Intelligence reports that \"vessel bunching,\" defined as exceeding scheduled sailings in a week, has surged, particularly between Northern Europe and Asia, which accounts for over 70% of bulk timber trade. Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence, explains that while offered capacity may appear consistent over two weeks, the irregular distribution of sailings creates a high workload in one week and none in the next.",

For the simple reason that our need moving product through the supply chain continues to grow.\n\nBack in 2020, many companies scrambled to find warehouse space to overcome the flow interruptions.  Some segments are seeing a retraction over the past year and this was not a surprise.  There are two main reasons.  First is that with the flow of goods restored to a more steady and reliable movement, there is less need to hold excess inventory and pay extra for contingency plans.  Second is that companies are reevaluating their supply chain networks to ensure the operations are optimized.  Many short-term decisions were made in 2020 that can be improved upon now that life is back to a more steady state.",

As a US citizen, I prefer to get it from my family rather than importing from other countries. DHL quoted me about $450, which is quite high, plus potential duties. I'm shipping to a residential address, hoping that helps. Can anyone recommend a shipper or forwarder who could offer a much lower rate? While I know it won't be $50, I could manage around $200. Additionally, some trusted friends might visit soon, and I'm checking if they can bring the laptop. I'll also contact some old forwarder connections. Thanks for your help!",

The operations of a carrier get affected by the currency fluctuations that happen on a daily basis. Some currency changes can be so drastic that it affects the operability. This is addressed by the CAF. \nSome carriers, though few now, charge it as a % of the freight (they used to) but it is cumbersome to maintain so they have a lump sum dollar amount. It generally covers every situation but even if any drastic changes between one currency pair results in some operability issues it is compensated by the profit from another.",

We produce knitwear and ship large orders for fashion brands, but we've recently faced significant charges, including about 30% in taxes‚Äî21% Dutch VAT plus additional import duties‚Äîtotaling nearly 50% of the goods' value. This impacts our margins, especially since this client constitutes 20-30% of our annual turnover. I have a few questions: 1. VAT Recovery: Is there a way to reclaim Dutch VAT? We receive a bill from DHL after shipping. Would registering for VAT in the Netherlands help, or are there other options? 2. Reducing Import Costs: Any suggestions for lowering import duties or fees? Can tariff codes, trade agreements, or similar strategies be utilized? 3. Shipping Strategies: Would altering our shipping or customs process help reduce costs? Has anyone experienced similar issues? Any tips would be greatly appreciated, as this client is vital to us, and we need to improve our shipment costs. Thank you! EDIT: I forgot to mention we are based in the UK, and our client has a warehouse in both the UK and the Netherlands.",

They can get VAT reimbursement while you can't. For the duty, if any, he can pay it also and then seek reimbursement from you.\n\n  \nI have a customer who sends containers from Israel to Portugal. He agreed to Delivery Duty Paid with the BUYER. We clear the container using the Importer's VAT and charge the importer the duty. Then, we send the exporter a copy of the import customs clearance that shows the VAT/DUTY with instructions to reimburse the buyer for the duty.\n\n  \n[https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/YSr3r8rw/Untitled-1.jpg)\n\nField 47  \nA00: DUTY, %6.5 on 32966.59‚Ç¨, 2142.83‚Ç¨.

The answer is yes, the only liability you incur is if CBP performs an inspection and the items they flag should have records of what it is and it's current entry status (inbond/cleared). Best practice is to outlay the flooring of your warehouse to clearly distinguish where bonded goods are stored. Usually, this is already setup as CBP performs accreditation checks when approving bonded facilities. Hope this helps!",

However, my parcel has been stuck at DHL customs for over a week because they need MYUS‚Äôs French VAT number to assess taxes. MyUS hasn't responded to my emails, WhatsApp messages, or calls, and DHL informed me that MyUS lacks a French VAT number. The only solution seems to be paying the $275 in taxes, or they will return the package to MyUS. What should I do?",

    "content": "Yesterday, I bought two items on eBay and sent them to my new MyUS.com account. Unfortunately, I couldn't select international shipping directly with these sellers. The packages are set to be delivered to my address in Poland. I've just noticed the many negative reviews for MyUS.com, which I should have checked earlier... my oversight :( Since the packages are on their way to the MyUS warehouse in Sarasota, FL (expected to arrive tomorrow), I‚Äôd like your advice on configuring my account to avoid unexpected fees and taxes. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far: 1. I opted for a Premium account for the first month with no initial fee, allowing 30 days without storage fees and the option to consolidate the packages for shipping. 2. I plan to delete my account once the packages arrive instead of switching to a free membership, as I‚Äôve read some incur a $10 fee for that switch. I assume deleting my account won‚Äôt have any charges? 3. I prefer the ‚ÄòDPD Powered by Aramex‚Äô shipping option over ‚ÄòBudget Economy.‚Äô The DPD option requires selecting ‚ÄòDuties and Taxes‚Äô to be included with the shipping fee, which seems convenient but might lead to high charges, as I‚Äôve heard they can overcharge VAT as ‚Äò3rd party costs.‚Äô 4. I set the ‚ÄòMerchandise shipping schedule‚Äô to ‚ÄòHold‚Äô because I want to initiate the shipping order myself once both packages are in the system. I‚Äôve seen reviews where people were surprised by automatic shipping and unexpected charges. 5. I opted out of ‚ÄòEnhanced Liability Protection.‚Äô Is spending an extra $3.5 on that worthwhile? 6. I also opted out of ‚ÄòUrgent Handling‚Äô to avoid extra fees. 7. In ‚ÄòPacking Options,‚Äô I left everything unselected. Is there any benefit to shipping in original boxes (if possible)? They don‚Äôt mention any fees for that. Do you have any other tips for preparing for my MyUS.com experience? It‚Äôs somewhat funny that I‚Äôm worrying about potential issues due to my own oversight, and I'm bracing myself for a possible struggle with their customer service üòä Please reassure me!",

I'll be using USPS for shipping. Should I return the camera and consider another option? What should I do?",

My friend in Greece wants to collect the package for me, but since I was only visiting, ELTA Cargo informed me that a third party cannot pick it up without authorized paperwork from Greece, which can't be done online. This seems unreasonable since I'm not in Greece right now. How can I obtain the necessary authorization, and why wasn't I informed beforehand that the package would be returned? I just want my belongings back. Can anyone assist or provide information? Thank you!",

You probably need to arrange for standards certification before clearing German Customs ahead of time such as but not limited to  adjustments to the headlights, emissions systems, and other safety features. Vehicles must meet the Euro 6 standards, which significantly limit the levels of exhaust emissions. Post importation you'd need to go through:\n\n* **Vehicle Registration:**¬†To have a vehicle that‚Äôs legally recognized, the owner needs to register it with the local authorities. This registration process involves submitting proof of ownership, insurance, and a valid identification card.\n* **Technical Inspection:**¬†A mandatory technical inspection (T√úV) is required to ensure the vehicle meets all German road safety and environmental standards.\n* **Modifications:**¬†If any modifications were necessary to meet import standards, proof of these changes might be required at registration.\n\nYou probably need both a German freight forwarder slash Customs broker as well as a Legal expert to get this done. By the time you succeed (not entirely guaranteed) you will have spent enough to buy 10 motorcycles locally.\n\n**My best advice: don't**",

I would appreciate some reassurance from those who have used YANWEN, as I feel anxious waiting for parcels.

I can't remember what I spent on the tape. I used bubble wrap I had on hand. Not sure that that would have cost. \nCreated a UPS account. Received a shipping discount from having a UPS account. \nGround shipping with insurance was $48 instead of $93. I think the PlayStation 4 I am shipping is not as big and heavy as the PS5 I shipped. So that will also reduce the price a bit. It is $48 to ship the PS4 myself. I used the UPS store to pack and ship the PS5 for $93. \nTo be clear the PS4 shipped myself came with a 22% discount. If I applied that discount to the PS5 shipping price of $93 it would have been $72.54. UPS packing was $30.\nPacking the PS4 myself was around $12-$15.\n\nSo to compare apples to apples. UPS store for insurance and packaging was $123 for shipping ground. For the PS5. \nFor me to ship through the UPS .com myself:\nU-haul cost was $7+$1.56+$5\nUPS $48 for the PS4\n\nLet's say I shipped the PS5 myself.\nPotential cost would have been\n$72.54 rounded up to the nearest dollar would be\n$73 with insurance\nPacking it myself would have been roughly $15\nTotal cost to ship PS5 myself:\n$88. \nTo compare the PS5 store vs shipping PS5 myself:\n\n$123 UPS store \n$88 myself\nEquals and savings of around $35 if I had shipped the PS5 myself.\nThat's a 28.46% savings.\n\nIf I take pictures (which I did) of how I packed the device. I'm hoping I can collect insurance money if needed. To cover any shipping related problems. I'm sure that would not be easy either way. From what I read and hear. It's not easy to collect insurance money from UPS Shipping related problems. \n\nI, of course considered all the suggestions and ideas given in the comment section. To figure out what would be the best/ Cost-Effective way to ship a Coast-to-Cost package here in the US. I'm sure there are even better ways to acquire more savings. I'm going to continuously monitor this Reddit thread. \n\nI'm excited to see what other suggestions and ideas can be found and utilized to save more money in the future. \n\nPlease let me know what you think. I feel like this may be a good solution. Shipping myself could equal a 28.46% savings per shipment. That will add up to quite a bit of savings after 10 deliveries and beyond.",

We are The Boston Typewriter Orchestra, an 8-member group using manual typewriters, each weighing 30-40 pounds. Previously, we struggled to transport our typewriters for gigs beyond driving distance, as flying with them was problematic. FedEx Freight Box offered a solution by providing a large cardboard box for our gear, allowing us to ship to Florida for under $300. While the logistics were smooth and the staff helpful, the account management system was a disaster, requiring multiple calls to set up different types of accounts. I spent 1.5 hours on the phone for my first shipment due to website issues. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve been over-billed twice, with one charge for a residential pickup despite using the freight depot. The first billing issue remains unresolved, and the second shipment resulted in a $2,800 bill instead of the expected $249. The collections team has been unhelpful and unresponsive. I want to continue using the Freight Box service for upcoming tours, but the administrative challenges are discouraging. 1. FedEx, please assist with the billing error of $2,800 versus $249. 2. FedEx, please improve your administrative processes; I want to appreciate the Freight Box service.",

    "content": "I'm sharing my initial comment to clarify my reasons for posting. For the community: do your businesses balance technology adoption with the need for flexibility in supply chains, or is this not a current focus? I recently attended the IMD Leading the Future Supply Chain program, which reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and provided new insights into the evolving landscape of supply chain management. A significant topic was Supply Chain 5.0 and its link to Industry 4.0 technologies. \n\nSo, what is Supply Chain 5.0? It represents an evolution from Industry 4.0, which emphasizes digital transformation through IoT, AI, robotics, and big data. In contrast, Supply Chain 5.0 focuses on a human-centric approach, merging advanced technology with human intelligence and creativity to create a resilient, adaptable, and sustainable supply chain.\n\nWhy does this matter for Industry 4.0? While Industry 4.0 has equipped us with tools for automation and optimization, Supply Chain 5.0 enhances this by integrating the human element. It stresses the need for collaboration between digital systems and human expertise to improve problem-solving, foster innovation, and respond effectively to market changes.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chain: Collaboration Between People and Technology. The program highlighted that the essence of Supply Chain 5.0 is collaborative intelligence‚Äîutilizing machine learning and AI for data analysis while empowering humans to interpret and apply this data creatively and strategically. This not only boosts operational efficiency but also aligns supply chain practices with sustainability and ethical standards, addressing consumer and regulatory demands for responsible business practices.\n\nKey Takeaways from the IMD Program: \n1. Digital Transformation is Essential, but Human Insight is Irreplaceable: Technology should enhance human capabilities, not replace them.\n2. Sustainability and Resilience Go Hand-in-Hand: Supply Chain 5.0 allows for efficient and socially responsible systems.\n3. Preparedness for the Unexpected: Combining human intelligence with real-time data helps anticipate disruptions and respond agilely.\n\nMoving forward, it's evident that the future of supply chain management will intertwine high-tech innovation with human intuition. I look forward to sharing more insights on applying these learnings in our operations to advance in this dynamic field. Let‚Äôs embrace the journey toward a more connected, adaptive, and human-centric supply chain! ü§ùüí°",

Where we are currently at as an industry, it is impossible to get to the full actualization of Industry 4.0 without integrating the principles of Supply Chain 5.0. This is due to the reasons you mentioned; human insight is still irreplaceable within the supply chain world.\n\nToday, the most effective way to implement Industry 4.0 is to start from a human-centric approach - understanding existing human work processes and integrating digital solutions to enhance/accelerate them (rather than replacing them altogether). \n\nIt'll take a long time before we are truly able to remove the human element out of the equation. Until then, we need to understand how to best mesh man and machine together.",

I myself am a demand planner, so I‚Äôll try to help, but I‚Äôm not always great at dumbing it down to put it plainly.\n\nSales and marketing needs to know how much of product X sold over Y time period. There‚Äôs a few different situations they may be trying to discern:\n\n1. How is Product X selling? Good? Bad? Selling below, at, or above forecast? Selling below, at, or above other products in its category? Performing better or worse YOY if an ongoing product? Does it exhibit seasonality (sells better during certain times and worse the rest of the time)? \n\n2. How is Promotion A performing? Marketing planned and executed a promotion for 10% off Product X in October, how did that affect sales of Product X? \n\n3. How does Product X perform relative to other products you sell? Is it a top SKU (A SKU), middle SKU (B SKU), or shit tier SKU (C or even worse, D SKU)? \n\n4. If sales and marketing is considering launching a new product, how does products similar to that product sell? \n\nThere‚Äôs lots more situations, but these are some common ones I deal with relative to sales and marketing. Some of the more specific situations are channel specific, such as how many units sell per store on average? There is different situations and insights if we are presenting to upper management or finance (more big picture financial stuff like are your forecasts meeting current company trend forecast or are you above/below? How‚Äôs your overall forecast bias? What‚Äôs your unproductive inventory situation?)\n\nMost of your insights will be derived from unit sales. You will want to confirm if they need their insights in units or in dollars. If in dollars, you will want to convert your insights from units to either gross or net sales depending on the situation. \n\nThis is highly simplified and obviously what we do is much more nuanced than this. \n\nAnd again, this is stuff they should be teaching you. Demand planning is indeed a higher level job that kind of combines supply chain concepts with business concepts and requires a good understanding of business math, KPIs, interpretation, statistics, and critical thinking among other things.",

I'd appreciate insights on potential issues in this field, along with your top pros and cons. Additionally, I‚Äôd like to know the expected salary for a first full-time job in Supply Chain and career progression after a few years, so I can compare it to accounting for my future planning.",

We never know what we‚Äôll receive when we place an order; it‚Äôs always uncertain, and we often get shortage notifications after the truck has already been picked up or even delivered. This happens almost with every load, despite being a major distributor for them. Is this common in other industries? For instance, I recently went to pick up a full truckload with 20 pallets weighing around 40,000 lbs, only to learn that we were shorted 10 pallets and about 22,000 lbs of product after my truck was en route back.

After that, I plan to pursue an MBA at ASU, focusing on either general business or supply chain. However, I seek opinions on whether the $40k investment for the master's is worthwhile. I'm 27, living in Phoenix, AZ, and I hold an associate degree in Business (MCC, 2019) and a bachelor's in Finance (ASU, 2021), with three years of experience at a lead investing firm in a non-licensed role. I intend to research supply chain areas of interest in the coming weeks. I enjoyed a basic supply chain class during my senior year at ASU, but I'm uncertain if it was just a passing interest or a career path for me, yet I enrolled in the certificate program, which I'm seriously considering. My future goal is to earn a comfortable salary. While I prefer not to work at a desk, I feel limited by my skills and background. I dislike the idea of returning for an MBA, but if it helps me achieve my goals, I'm willing to invest. I also aspire to work remotely or in a travel-friendly role, even if it takes time to reach that position. ASU is introducing a SCM Procurement certificate for under $2k, which I might pursue to enhance my credentials alongside or instead of the MBA, as both certificates count towards MBA credits. I'm also considering obtaining the certificates first, gaining experience, and seeking a company to fund my MBA if possible. Currently, I earn about $54k and cannot afford to pay out of pocket, which is a significant factor in my decision. Any advice or recommendations?",

If you dealt with P&L, that goes great with inventory - inventory turnover/holding costs/yada yada. Also, S&OP and AOP go hand in hand. Demand forecasting, inventory planning, etc.,  it ALL goes back to finance. You won't be starting at that high of a level, but you could probably throw it in somewhere in your job descriptions Use ChatGPT to help you translate your current background with jobs you might be looking at. Like... How does my experience from my resume (or you can just type paragraphs of what you've done) align with this job description. I did it for the role I finally got after three months of looking...  I used it more for my interview as well to explain, in person, how my skills related to the job. \n\nI say an MBA won't really help you here based on personal experience. I got an executive MBA for a few reasons, one of which was thinking it would make me more competitive. I think it did to an extent, but I already had several years of real world experience in what I was doing. I think it made more of a difference in getting into management roles or moving between industries (which I've done every job change). I think people it saw it as a \"we could promote her\" versus just a \"she will be great in this supply chain role because she has an MBA\". I think certifications and skills will mean more. Learning SQL and Excel are great! Any statistical skills? Great for analyst. If not, you can learn them. Udemy and Coursera are your friends. \n\nFYI - remote roles are EXTREMELY competitive. I have nearly ten years' supply chain experience, my MBA, and an undergrad from a pretty well recognized school and in my past few months of job hunting, I only had ... two interviews for remote roles. Remote work is shrinking and most remote roles that I have been seeing are high level or more technical analyst roles.",

My responsibilities included overseeing freight train crews, equipment, and materials, as well as coordinating meetings among various departments and maintaining records of equipment and materials nationwide. I‚Äôm now seeking a remote position, particularly in supply chain management, which seems to have many opportunities. I understand that these roles require knowledge of loads, containers, driver management, and teamwork. I‚Äôm interested in buyer positions and other roles that may be new to me. I would appreciate advice on bridging my railroad experience to a career in supply chain, including recommended courses or certifications, and whether I should consider entry-level positions for industry knowledge. Since leaving the railroad, I‚Äôve focused on web development (I hold a degree in Computer Science), but I miss project management and teamwork. I hope to leverage my 17 years in transportation and project management in a similar role. Thank you for your time and any guidance you can offer.",

If you're in a less competitive area, they'll be more likely to take people with transferable skills versus direct experience. The role I'm about to start doesn't really relate to what I have done in the past, but I have a lot of transferable skills. The talent pool out here is also pretty small. I think you have good experience, but it might be hard to translate it to companies when you're competing against a lot of highly qualified people. That being said... \n\nOne thing you can do is go through a recruiting firm that specializes in military.  I am a veteran who got a planner/scheduler role as my first job post-military. It gave me the foundation for everything else I've done. I went to a hiring conference through a military recruiting firm, so employers knew  we weren't necessarily going to have any \"real-world\" experience in that job. They weren't even specifically recruiting for that job, but the recruiter showed them my resume and they really liked what they saw. My undergrad was in psychology but I had IT experience which translated wonderfully into the machine scheduling piece. I did the officer thing after being enlisted, but they were more interested in my IT experience than my officer experience.\n\nAlso, if you haven't used them, Recruit Military and Hiring our Heroes have veteran specific hiring events. They have in-person and virtual. I've been unemployed a few months and have been using them. I didn't find my upcoming job through either method because I'm located in an area without many employers and remote roles are either a) super competitive, or b) didn't match my skillset. BUT, I made connections and have new people on my LinkedIn and people to e-mail when I apply to jobs at those companies. You can talk one on one with recruiters and hiring managers, so it will help get your name noticed if nothing else!",

For the exam, I was allowed to bring water and my calculator, but the on-screen calculator was already a full scientific one. I didn't need them since I could do the few math questions in my head, despite not being great at it. I had to place other electronics in a locker, and bathroom breaks were relaxed‚Äîno need to raise my hand, as the proctor said, \"I'm not a monster.\" The exam took me about three hours, and the questions were quite similar to the CSCP practice tests on Udemy, minus the typos. Although I wasn't a fan of the Udemy tests, they were probably worth the $12 since I scored 80-90%. Most questions were one-liners, with about 60% categorized as \"easy,\" especially after practicing APICS quizzes. Around 10% were unexpected, while the rest were moderately difficult, and I felt mostly confident in my answers. Training myself to read each question carefully helped, as I often missed key words when rushing. \n\nI scheduled the test for early October, created a study plan, and then got bacterial pink eye, which limited my reading for two weeks. I studied intensively the last week or two, despite my still-impaired vision. My initial practice test score was 57%, which was slightly better than the pre-test but discouraging. It motivated me to review all questions with GPT for clarification before retaking it, achieving a 94% score‚Äîthough I should have gotten 100% since it was the same questions. My average score on chapter/module quizzes was around 75%. I took notes on the 28 quizzes, revisited them, and sought GPT's help for consistent mistakes. After two rounds, I focused on the four quizzes where I scored below 70%. Fun fact: I started CSCP last year while working as a purchasing manager at a hotel and landed a job requiring the cert in June, which came with a 20% raise, partly due to what I learned. This is part of my transition from chef to supply chain management.",

This is my first internship, and I graduate in December 2025, which isn't ideal, but it's a start. I aim to work in planning or procurement after college, and although this internship is more general, I‚Äôm eager to gain any experience.

They expect you to give your soul to them. I spent MANY 12, 14, even 16 hour days busting my ass and almost never got a thank you or any kind of recognition. Nothing you do there will ever be enough. Look up their turnover rate; they pay well because they are constantly replacing young people who cannot get out of there fast enough. I joined through their management training program with 11 other people in my region and after about 7 years all of us had left. I cannot give a stronger recommendation to look elsewhere for a full time career.",

On top of this, knowing what the larger market is doing and how a product might need to be repositioned to better capture the target audience. A marketing degree is a step to it, but it's not the key. Experience is the key. \n\n\nI would suggest looking at account management roles as they will be easier to get interviews and then transition into category/product management.",

Build up your soft skills. At least in my company, the lowest level for a PM is x3 and entry level is x1. They literally will not hire you as an x3 with little experience unless you have a masters and internship experience. Most x3‚Äôs that are hired straight from college actually had an internship in the company first and proved during their internship that they can be given any project and succeed in a short amount of time which built trust with the hiring managers. I myself came from a supply chain background and started in the company as x2 and worked my way up internally to eventually land a x4 product role. The space that I am in now has a lot to do with my previous SC background and that helped me thrive in my current role.",

My undergraduate degree is unrelated to supply chain or my current role. Since 2019, I've worked in sales, starting with account management for two years before moving to sales operations, where I've been for almost three years. I began in software but have shifted to heavier industries, specifically energy and now aviation. My role involves significant data analysis and operational improvements, including sales forecasting, fare loading, dashboard creation, sales performance analysis, process enhancement, tender sourcing, and various other tasks. While in university, I also did security and WHS site safety work in logistics and warehousing. One of my sales operations roles was at an EDI provider, and I have experience building an unsuccessful e-commerce store, which highlighted the logistical challenges of rapid scaling. I have used SAP for PO processing, Netsuite for sales orders, Salesforce, Power BI, Qliksense, PRISM, and Excel extensively. I recently completed a graduate certificate in data science, using R and Python, but I dislike it and lack the technical skills for advanced data science or AI. Given my experience, how realistic is it to transition into supply chain and quickly advance to leadership and management roles?",

    "content": "After recent events, I'm questioning whether to continue my current path. I'm turning 33 soon, and following a major accident and hospitalization, I'm rethinking my career in analytics. I have six years of experience in sales and sales operations, analysis, and reporting, primarily in software, renewable energy, and aviation, but I haven't worked in supply chain. I transitioned from account management to reporting and analysis, gaining experience with various platforms like Excel, Salesforce, Power BI, SAP, Netsuite, PRISM, and Qliksense. I also handled tasks like bid management, tender sourcing, contract management, and process improvement. I recently completed a graduate diploma in data science, where I struggled with Python and R, but I passed with help from Google and ChatGPT. I've been wanting to shift to supply chain and logistics, believing my skills, especially in sales operations, would be valuable. However, I'm uncertain if it's worth moving away from analytics since I feel burnt out. My salary has been low, possibly due to my performance, and many analytical positions receive numerous applications, particularly the higher-paying ones. I‚Äôve considered exploring more commercially focused areas like contracts, procurement, project management, and operations management, which still utilize data but emphasize a business perspective. I've looked into various courses for advancing in supply chain, including a Master's in Operations Management, an MBA in Supply Chain Management, and others. What do you think?",

We‚Äôre using Tableau for 5 years at our company and in last couple years I‚Äôve seen a huge surge in PowerBI just because it seems more user friendly for both Ops and Analytics. I‚Äôve only seen Python used a handful of times. SQL is definitely good to learn to build the data structure that goes into PowerBI but I‚Äôve seen more data centralized teams being built to focus on that part and a lot of Data Analytics teams purely focus on creating analytics tools for end-users. I have been part of interviews for Analytics roles and there are times when they‚Äôll ask questions like how would you write this query to find the data for your analysis, etc and sometimes it‚Äôs as easy as ‚Äúour warehouses store data on a local time zone, how would you convert this over to UTC time zone?‚Äù I started as a supply chain analyst working on forecasting and replenishment and told my manager that I have an interest in analytics so they had some of my peers teach me Tableau and SQL and then gave me small projects to work on to learn and apply those skills. Eventually, I was able to focus primarily on data analytics and made the switch over to the tech band.",

    "content": "I recognize this topic is contentious and aim to avoid provoking anger, but I genuinely seek practical insights on a specific scenario. Since the election, there have been complaints about upcoming tariffs, but my focus is on whether replacing all corporate taxes with import tariffs would allow companies that rely on imports to maintain similar price points. Specifically, what tariff percentage would likely result in a net-neutral impact on costs of goods sold, keeping end-user prices stable? My current view is that there will be considerable short to mid-term challenges with both taxes and tariffs, but potential long-term benefits if manufacturing returns domestically. However, I lack sufficient industry knowledge to understand the implications of a system with only tariffs and no taxes.",

I've decided to pursue a career as an inventory specialist to move away from manual labor, as I prefer the structured nature of inventory management over managing people. This certification seemed like a way to transition to a more professional role and earn a better salary. However, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I researched options and chose CPIM since I don‚Äôt want to pursue a degree, but now I find the material daunting, as it feels more suited for someone with a degree in the field. I underestimated my knowledge and am questioning if this will truly help me enter the career I desire. Is it realistic to think I can succeed when I feel like a beginner in the terminology? UPDATE: I appreciate the unexpected support and encouragement. Thank you all for your kind words! I plan to study an hour daily, use pocket prep, and download Speechify. You are all amazing‚Äîthank you!",

I don‚Äôt really have a head for the business planning side of things, and never had experience with it because I didn‚Äôt need to, so a lot of the first book was really tough for me. Just take it slow, take the learning center quizzes multiple times, and try the Pocket Prep app as well. \n\nIt‚Äôll help to have the certification, especially if you‚Äôre looking to move into inventory management.",

Everything will start coming together once have read all the material the first time. You'll need to read it 2 to 3 times. You probably should've started with CSCP.\n\nMake a goal to read 10 pages a day. With that pace, you'll read one of the three text books in about a month. Get a reading app to read the material to help review while you are commuting, doing chores or out for a walk.\n\nPocket Prep is a must. Get through all 1600 questions. Make a habit to do the *Question of Day* and *a Quick 10 Quiz* every morning. Spend some time reading the explanations. Ask ChatGPT about any questions that you struggle with.\n\nAs for the section quizzes don't worry about them the first time thru the material. They will be hard in the beginning because they just don't cover concepts in that section but cover things you haven't studied yet in future chapters. Just skim the section and look for key concepts then take the quiz before you read the section. This way you get a look at what you'll need to pay attention to in the section. After you read the section take the quiz again. Don't worry too much about the score the first time thru the material.  The second time thru the material try to get 80% on each section quiz.\n\nAfter this think about going to college. You'll be thankful later in life. If not just cert yourself up then. Every year aim for a new cert. At least with a CPIM, CSCP, LSSGB , PMP, CPF, CLTD, CSTC, MITx MM, DDMRP you might have a chance for better jobs later in life.\n\nPace yourself and relax. You got this! Good luck!",

You need to finish 5 courses and take final exam to receive the final certificate. But each course has its own exam, deadline and certificate. It is pretty intense.\n\nMy friend is working in procurement at a very large car manufacturer in Japan and I discussed with her often during the course.

    "content": "Hello everyone, I'm struggling to calculate delivery costs per delivery point in a Milk Run system. I have a cistern truck that delivers to 1 to 6 points per load, with various products and quantities. The truck charges me a per km and a daily rate. For km costs, I noted the odometer readings at departure, each delivery point, and arrival. For 3 Delivery Points (DP): DP 1's km cost is divided by 3; DP 2's cost includes DP1's km divided by 3 plus km from DP1 to DP2 divided by 2; DP 3's cost includes DP1's km divided by 3, DP1 to DP2's km divided by 2, and DP2 to DP3's km divided by 1. I'm unsure about dividing return km among the 3 DPs, so any suggestions would be appreciated. Each DP's costs are then averaged by the product quantities delivered, converting to ‚Ç¨/kg. The km calculations seem mostly resolved, but I'm uncertain about the daily fixed cost. Often, the truck loads today and returns tomorrow after making those 3 DPs, and sometimes it delivers a partial load to a nearby customer before returning for a larger delivery. For this, I have a few ideas: calculate hourly costs based on the daily rate for the time spent from departure to return for each run; divide the fixed cost by the quantities delivered at each point as a weighted average (our previous method, but without km costs); or allocate the fixed cost like the km cost. I'm leaning towards calculating hourly costs for each run and then distributing this cost per DP, similar to the km method. Thank you for your assistance!",

        "content": "Well this is long because I‚Äôve been interviewing for jobs and going back on everything I have done. So you get lots of details on my seven years of inventory management!\n\nNot sure what your supply chain background is, it‚Äôs good if you like data and analyzing it. Which I do. It‚Äôs the foundation for a lot of supply roles and it‚Äôs good to have an understanding of it. I hated the physical inventory piece - I‚Äôd rather just do the forecasting and planning piece. \n\n\nRoles were different but all had similar elements and concepts. In my last role I was officially in charge of inventory - it was part of my job title - Materials Planning and Inventory Manager. A lot of spreadsheets and reports. I tracked aging inventory, inventory turns/usage, inventory accuracy and our warehouse management. Made sure our planning team and production staff were actually USING the old material, so there was a lot of people influencing. Did a lot with physical inventory but I‚Äôm not sure every inventory manager role does that. Mine was onsite. So, I had to manage our cycle count process (rather, create it because there wasn‚Äôt one), make sure our inventory counts were accurate, and our material was where it was supposed to be. So I did a lot with setting up and managing our automated systems. I wasn‚Äôt there long enough to get a super strong grasp on all of the intricacies of that industry and those specific materials; unfortunately, we got acquired and I guess my role was redundant (I was scared from day one with my role being new),  but I was starting to take over certain product lines. I used history to manage our ordering patterns.. I had a LOT of SKUS to track - over 7000 to be exact. And it was over multiple facilities, so the physical inventory piece was really challenging. Multiple people managed each facility. I‚Äôm actually really glad I got laid off that role (aside for needing to find a new one‚Ä¶ sigh). Physical inventory sucks. \n\n\nOther role, we didn‚Äôt have an inventory manager and my manager was the plant manager and not materials manager (we didn‚Äôt have one), but I did a lot of the same tasks as when I was an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù inventory manager- I just got paid half as much. I was a production planner and then operations manager and it was just a part of my responsibility to manage. If I didn‚Äôt, we either didn‚Äôt have the right material or we were under/over our customer requirements. I didn‚Äôt have to report anything - that was our finance team since it directly impacts financial numbers. As a production planner, I was mainly responsible for raw materials and as an operations manager I was mostly responsible for finished goods. But I was doing both for most of my time there (some long days). Since sales provided the ‚Äúforecast data‚Äù that I submitted, technically the next level set the actual material we were receiving (corporate master schedulers), but sales did a terrible job and we never got the right material - either too much or not enough - so I just pulled our historic data and fixed it myself before submitting it ü§£. Ultimately they had responsibility for customer communications, so if we had aging material because of them, I gave them the info and they had to talk to customers to see if they wouldn‚Äôt take it for something else. \n\nI set our inventory policies and made sure we were utilizing our inventory management software. On the manager side I was more worried about finished goods and getting inventory policies set for customers. \n\nThat‚Äôs an overview of what I did with inventory. It really is the backbone of all of it. Can‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt have a product, either raw for production or the finished product that goes to the customer.",

These large companies have the financial infrastructure to build in-house so why wouldn‚Äôt they go that route. Amazon for instance building their own data warehouse and AWS when they were primarily just an online retailer. It‚Äôs better to have control within their own company and build innovation than to rely on third party companies.",

        "content": "Volume is critical for this kind of thing as this means the difference between actually having them manufactured as opposed to buying from stock/wholesalers. From UK manufacturers you will be unlikely to get less than 10k if not 20k needed to be manufactured. This might even take some negotiation. If you're not reaching that you will need to buy from stock or get from somewhere like China. Regardless of where you buy from 5k is generally the absolute cut off for manufacturing as opposed to buying from stock, and in that instance you may have a setup fee due to low volume.\n\n  \nFor a soft plastic bottle you need to have a material like LDPE or MDPE. It's possible that they can use moulds for HDPE and use a more flexible grade. LD = low density / MD = Medium denisity / HD = High density. You could arguably use PET but if you have used a heinz ketchup bottle before you will know that although they are squeezy, they don't squeeze well.\n\nFor manufacturers/stockists in the UK you could consider the following, I do have many more manufacturers and some links overseas,\n\nSMurray\n\nMasom Freer\n\nSpectra\n\nFor stock try Richmond containers, but there are many more.\n\n  \nIf you actually need assistance on developing something my job is literally a packaging consultant. I'm based in the UK and can assist with anything packaging related. There are many more bottles available around the world and one of the initial things I often do for brands is give them multiple options before leading the project of implementing it if they like something (and if they want me to help anyway). It's not always as straight forward as it should be to implement it properly, safely and on time. I can help with that,\n\n  \nHappy to answer more of your questions for free though.

I would appreciate your feedback on the software described below. Specifically, do you find it useful, and if so, why? \n\n**Description**  \nI'm developing software that enables freight forwarders to track the real-time GPS location of truckers transporting their shipments.\n\n**How it Works**  \nThe software includes a mobile app and a web portal.  \n1. The forwarder assigns a shipment to a trucker.  \n2. The driver downloads the mobile app on their phone.  \n3. The forwarder inputs shipment and driver details.  \n4. The software matches the shipment to the driver based on the entered information.  \n5. The driver receives a notification about the shipment, and tracking begins.  \n6. The forwarder is notified upon reaching milestones, such as pickup, halfway point, and delivery.  \n\nThe software requires the driver‚Äôs consent to track their location. I look forward to your thoughts. Thank you!",

Like the other comment, most are wrapped with foil. It doesn't make it impermeable to air, but it is an alternative to putting them in sachets before cartons.\n\nFor this there are a range of options in terms of carton box styles. Generally speaking these dielines are made with certain softwares that carton manufacturers have. You need the right software or generator to do it. There are hundreds anf thousands of designs out there but in your instance you need to determine what you want,\n\n1. tubular STYLE cartons - think of a regular 4 sided box that is long and tuck in panels at either side. \n\n2. Pillow style packs - These are not common for chocolote bars however it is possible to do long and thin versions of this with tight curves. \n\n3. tray style cartons with integrated or separate lids. \n\n4. Paper tubes - UK example is a company called visican. YOu would need to find someone local to you. \n\n5. Something more unique and shaped\n\nI'm a packaging developer now, but used to be a structural designer so I know all about how to make nets and the software used. If I were you go on packmage and get yourself a trial.. If you want more help feel free to DM me and I will answer questions in more depth.",

Many companies have 0 packaging engineers and want to hire 1 so there is nobody to teach you anything.   It can be a role you move into, or assume responsibility for without experience  from some adjacent manufacturing or logistics  role at some places, but a fresh hire at a new company they are looking for someone from one of the main schools of packaging.   Also it can be a remote role,  but only for an experienced packaging engineer who is good at CAD and doing their own design work, plus has some support on site.  As a fresh engineer who knows nothing not a chance, you need to interact with everything to learn.  Samples, testing , your going to have a desk full of boxes/inserts your working on, meeting with supplier etc.  Also you will be called to the floor to investigate any and all packaging issues.",

The different softwares used for carton construction are.\n\n\nArtiocad (most popular)\nEngview\nImpack\nKasemake\n\n\nMajor manufacturers are likely to use one of these.\n\n\nAlso check out ECMA (folding cartons) and FEFCO (corrugated). These are standards which includes many box styles. When designing something basic it's common to take a standard of a particular box and just change the dimensions and will change live in the software. These are generally the first point of call for many designs, that are then adapted accordingly for the product.\n\n\nThe CAD packages above often have these standards built into them. It's possible you could try getting a trial of packmage, which is a cheap less professional alternative of these CAD softwares. They may have these styles in them.\n\n\nAlso, might be worth to learn about flat bed cutters, the major companies that provide these are kongserg and Zund. If you are creating Carton profiles and need to test with the product you will be using one daily.\n\n\nAlmost make sure you know about board grades, GSM (board weight) or micron/ums). You may also consider the type of boards available in your market.\n\n\nYou may also want to consider:\n- grain direction¬†\n- make ready times\n- print methods for the company or. Litho\n- diecutter\n- folding/gluing machines etc\n- tolerances.\n\n\nPhew. After all this I truly hope when you said structural is that it's actually based in the carton industry and not something like 3D glass or plastic.\n\n\nI was a packaging structural designer for 3 years in the UK for a large American manufacturer. I left many years ago and moved into packaging development. These days I work with all materials, not just board.\n\n\nGood luck. Feel free to message me if you have any more questions.",

For example if they're designing a brand new bottle shape vs a design application to an existing bottle: these are two very different skill sets and deliverables. \n\nI have experience working with internal and external teams as well as a mix. My previous years of experience was that large new designs were outsourced to a creative person or group and then executed internally and then maintained internally. The suppliers always did the engineering technical work etc.  my current experience is fortunate in that my team manages the external packaging design agency directly and owns the entire process. Marketing and internal creative do not have a say beyond launch timing and promotional execution of the product once it is developed by the product team on which we sit. I prefer this although it is rare. \n\nDealing with internal creative and marketing teams is a headache for \"service functions\" such as packaging folks in most industries because, as you mentioned, we are forced to have all the accountability but have zero actual power or decision making abilities. Unfortunately that's just how CPG works because everything is tied to sales and thus marketing drives decision making and creative is often controlled directly by marketing.",

Although I have prior experience, I've never been the decision-maker. We're aiming to eliminate zip ties from our packaging to comply with UK regulations and a major distributor's requirements. I work for a tool company with open packaging, which makes it challenging to secure some difficult products. I‚Äôve used paper twine before, but my boss thinks it appears too juvenile and prefers something more suitable for our brand. I'm seeking alternatives that would be acceptable to him. I've considered waxed twine, but I worry he might dislike that too. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Yes, you can start with a bag and a label sticker instead of a fully printed bag. It's also budget-friendly. As long as your label is designed well‚Äîclear, professional, and sticks securely‚Äîit can still work. Focus on quality materials for the bag itself and make sure the label communicates your brand‚Äôs vibe. A lot of small businesses start this way. Plus, as your business grows, you can always upgrade to printed packaging later. It might be worth comparing prices between [sticker labels](https://www.uprinting.com/stickers-and-labels.html) and [custom packaging](https://www.uprinting.com/packaging-printing.html) to make the best choice for now.",

        "content": "I sell packaging to large and small coffee roasters. Even the big guys use labels on their packaging, especially if they're introducing a new roast. Doesn't look bad at all! Just don't use a sandwich bag as your base. Lol. \n\n\nHere's what I would do: \n\n\nStartup Stage:\n\n- Buy some coffee bags off Amazon or Uline (or from whatever local supply house near you). I would recommend a box bottom bag, as it looks more professional.\n\n- Have some high end clear PP labels printed with your brand. Don't go to your local print/copy shop. Use a reputable label printer. Many of them can run MOQ as low as 100 labels (though pricing is better at higher volumes). \n- Affix to bag. Look like a million bucks. \n\n\nGrowth Stage: \n\n- Once your quantities are a little higher, look at printing a generic branded bag, but leave space for a clear label if you're introducing new roasts. We can print branded bags as few as 1,000pcs on our digital printer. However, we recommend at least 5,000pcs in order for the unit pricing to make sense. \n\n\nChugging Along Stage: \n\n- If you have a few core roasts that have significant recurring volumes, go ahead and print them right onto the bag. I'd still leave a generic bag to label for your new/seasonal roasts. \n\nIf you're selling e-commerce, I think the better option is getting a good website. Once your customer buys/tries/likes your product, the packaging is less of a selling feature and is more of a vanity point - if they've already ordered your product without seeing the packaging, then they're interested in the product itself, not whatever the bag looks like. \n\n\nDM me if you have any questions.",

Materials: Different packaging materials come with varying costs. 2. Finishes: The complexity of printing finishes greatly impacts pricing. 3. Customization: Unique design, printing technology, or structural requirements will affect the price. 4. Size and Structure: Generally, larger boxes with complex structures cost more due to processing and finishing. 5. Quantity: Larger order quantities usually lead to lower unit prices. 6. Design Fees: If professional design services are needed, this will add to the cost. Does anyone know if there are additional factors to consider? I need to budget for the price. Thank you.

When it comes to corrugated boxes, many companies don‚Äôt have their products tested to ensure they‚Äôre using the correct ECT. Flutes in the walls of the boxes dramatically change pricing.  Good suppliers will work closely with you to ensure you are utilizing the best options. Good luck and check at least 3 sources.",

For folding cartons there is offset and digital. For corrugated there‚Äôs flexo and digital. The offset and flexo printing usually has higher quality results and the digital usually allows for lower volume. The number of colors used to design your artwork comes into play and you would either use cmyk or spot colors. All of this affects pricing. After the print, finish is applied and then that factors in, too. \n\nThe more machines required in your process will be higher costs. \nIn folding cartons your standard set of machines is:\nPre-press print plates and layout plus wooden diecut tool making\nPress machine\nIf not in-line, then a finishing machine like UV, foil or embossing\nDiecut machine\nAfter diecut it goes to a waste removal process to remove the boxes from the excess paper of the sheet\nGlue machine",

        "content": "Shibidishoob gave a great answer and would refer to that first. It seems we both had a background in this area.\n\n\nBut in short and if I might add, for folding carton construction/shape only where gluing is basic, think straight lines, this is where the cost is lower and make ready times, the time to setup the machine, is reduced. When you have complex angles (tapered boxes) or auto lock/crash lock bases more money will be applied to the setup.\n\n\nThis will generally not be such an issue if you buy a higher quantity where the print time is much longer than setup.\n\n\nBesides the more use of graphical printing processes or finishing effects quantity aside the board/material is a major part of the unit cost. Though\n\n\nThe number of processes will probably increase the tooling and unit costs if you need dies.\n\n\nFinally, the only other thing I would mention is packing. If you're creating the overal cost of good, for the box you may need to determine the labour cost needed to fill it. Where you have inserts or complex boxes the time and cost to pack cab increase substantially. But, say you saved money on the box and opted to go for a cheaper envelope base carton (more manual) over a autolock or crash lock¬† base carton (quicker to assemble), the money saved on the box may now simply be moved to a higher labour cost. Food for thought.",

Heavier or fragile items usually need sturdy materials like corrugated cardboard, while lighter stuff can work with paperboard or chipboard.\n2. **Material**: If you're looking for eco-friendly options, kraft paper or biodegradable materials are great. For a premium touch, rigid boxes are a sleek option.\n3. **Box Size**: Make sure the box fits your product well to avoid using too much filler and to save on shipping costs.\n4. **Budget**: Balance between protecting your product and keeping costs reasonable.\n\nAlso, consider customization‚Äîprinting your logo or adding special finishes can give your packaging a polished, branded look. Plus, eco-friendly packaging is a big win with consumers these days!\n\nIf you're interested in a deeper dive, this guide breaks it all down: [The Ultimate Guide to Packaging](https://www.uprinting.com/ultimate-guide-to-packaging.html).

Don‚Äôt just hire a design studio. \n\nI think it‚Äôs important to determine your budget first, my background has been sourcing for packaging and I‚Äôve met some crazy cool concepts over the years, but they were also 10x our budget. Custom packaging means custom tools which means custom money. Keep in mind everytime the package is touched in manufacturing it adds cost, CMYK printing, Spot colors, foil, texture, coating, emboss/deboss, etc. \n\nMy brother majored in packaging science at RIT. They have a great testing lab there that you could potentially reach out to if you are on a very low budget. Customer experience is very important, but outside of the wow factor it‚Äôs even more important that your product arrives undamaged (if your shipping) ship testing is real. So is temperature, pressure, etc.",

    "content": "I've been in the packaging industry for over 35 years, and one of the most frequent questions I receive is about packaging. This lengthy post offers valuable insights, particularly on flexible packaging, which is the most recognized form. Flexible packaging includes items like pouches, bags, and plastic wraps, unlike rigid options such as bottles and boxes. \n\nI'll discuss the pouch, a popular item found globally, without delving into material structures. Here's a brief overview of the process for procuring flexible packaging from both the customer's and supplier's perspectives. When small brands seek packaging, they contact suppliers. Customers typically request pouches that stand up on shelves and feature recloseable zippers. Suppliers inquire about the application and size, which new brands often overlook. If the customer is unsure, they need to consider factors like product size, shelf life, display needs, opening methods, quantity, and design readiness. \n\nSuppliers provide options, some able to deliver quickly but at a higher cost, while many require minimum orders of 5,000 to 10,000 pouches. Short runs are mainly produced through digital printing, with the HP Indigo press being the most common, costing around $1.25 million. Pricing depends on footage and equipment efficiency rather than just the number of pouches. For instance, a 4‚Äù x 6‚Äù pouch requires 15‚Äù of film when laid flat. If the pouch height increases, efficiency decreases, leading to more waste.\n\nOnce printed, suppliers laminate the film to enhance strength and barrier properties. The film is then processed into pouches via custom machines that fold and seal the film, incorporating zippers and tear notches before final cuts and quality checks. \n\nFor a 5,000 pouch order, the manufacturer uses approximately 833-950 feet of film, costing between $0.75 and $1.25 per pouch. Digital printing allows for flexibility with multiple designs for different SKUs without changing the price significantly. As volume increases, pricing decreases. If you eventually need 50,000 pouches with various SKUs, you'll see considerable benefits.\n\nNew or growing brands should consider digital short-run pouches and budget accordingly, avoiding the pitfalls of imports. American-made pouches often provide better quality and communication with suppliers. Patience is crucial; allow time for design and request a dieline for proper artwork layout. Suppliers need vector-ready files, and working with a packaging designer is advisable to avoid potential issues.\n\nThe entire process can take 6-",

Luxury dealerships treat their consumers like royalty. From the initial introduction to the follow up after the purchase. \n\nSkincare products speak to consumers in the same manner. Premium packaging builds an emotional connection with consumers and sets the tone for the rest of the buying and use experience. Some well known brands have slightly scaled back on their packaging elegance, but their established well known brands. They also build an emotional connection with consumers through effective marketing.",

One thing to consider is that it‚Äôs not really a commoditized market where a consumer knows exactly what they‚Äôre buying. It‚Äôs a bit of a magic formulation - even if the ingredients are the same as another product, who knows the quality or quantity, or mfg process involved? People gravitate towards brands they know or trust. The brand carries meaning and value. And when you trust a firm in this way, they also ensure a good overall experience - if they didn‚Äôt cut corners on the 50 other components, why would they on packaging? Packaging also helps protect the product on a shelf and deliver a good experience when the customer uses it.\n\nI think packaging is very valuable in these products.",

I give them sustainable options to give them a choice but weight which portrays luxury or other luxury elements like foil can be very important for many brands.\n\n\nThere's glass and plastic that deliberately thick to give additional weight, there's even some makeup components that have added materials, sometimes metal deliberately to add weight.\n\n\nIf you want to be sustainable and luxury consider aluminum or glass. Thick heavy plastic, particularly clear plastic jars are generally not sustainable at all if this is of value to you. The trick is to be creative in terms of weight, materials, and artwork (generally being minimalistic).\n\n\n\n\nYou can also consider your secondary packaging (the cartons/boxes) you put them in as this can give the premiumisation with less impact on sustainability. Think shape, construction ,board weight, or other things. The shape of the boxes can give you standout appeal while using basic/off the shelves bottles/jar etc. Save money on the primary packaging but consider spending more on the secondary.\n\n\n\nHappy to give you some pointers or answer questions you may have. If you want actual more in depth help I do have some availability since it's my job :). Feel free to message me privately.",

        "content": "Ensure you know what you want to achieve with this as packaging like other areas is a mixed field.¬†\n\n\nI started off sort of as a packaging engineer having studied packaging and graphic design at university. I designed carton dielines at a carton manufacturer but it didn't satisfy my need or pay me enough, though it gave me an important initial technical understanding. Design in my experience doesn't pay much, at least initially, but¬† I will add the US tends to give a higher value to packaging professionals that other markets so my experience probably is not the same with anyone.\n\n\nI went back to university and concentrated on packaging development and got a job in this position at a brand, not a packaging manufacturer.Basically although I can influence design I was the middle man between marketing, suppliers, designers as part of the NPD team and am effectively a packaging project manager and the leader of anything packaging related when I became a packaging development manager.¬†\n\n\nTo answer your question more directly, your experience would probably work well in areas moulding plastic, glass or metal packaging where you can analyse the use of materials, the stresses, flow rates and sealing etc. This is probably more focused at a manufacturer that offers custom packaging developments. For a jump and if you have some money it might be worth looking into the institute of packaging course/IOP. Etc. in the UK at least this is less than ¬£4k and the US has something similar. It can be done in a week but would definitely give you a jump that would be appealing to employers. It would give you sufficient packaging knowledge particularly when you think that around the world packaging education is quite limited.",

Unfortunately, most US packaging suppliers haven't recovered since Covid.  They need help finding workers, aren't fully staffed, can't find workers to pass a drug test, etc.  Material quality has plummeted, customer service is unheard of these days (unless you like Push 1 for Sales, 2 for Customer Service, 3...) and no one really cares.   Look to Specialized Packaging...hard to solve packaging (Aseptic, Retort, High Temperature, engineered barrier film...etc).  The current suppliers of these packaging items are horrible...really horrible (short shipments, delays, 16 week on up lead times...etc).  Consider finding factories that can supply packaging they are having problems with and your sales will skyrocket.

At least in my experience, many similar processes and tools from ME can carry over to packaging. ME also will be a bit more intensive than a PE degree would offer, so you would see things get easier when you switch to a packaging career.\n\nIf you can't get a packaging degree, I'd suggest trying to get into a packaging company under an ME role so you can both work hands on around packaging to learn more, and be able to add it to your resume to make you more appealing for a packaging role without a packaging degree.\n\nUniversities are limited with packaging education, so it's not uncommon for people to be in packaging without going to school for it.",

        "content": "Look for IOP or IOPP and consider doing the course. Unfortunately you might need some degree of education to get into it and then a junior position. Businesses have a very different opinion of how specialised packaging employees need to be and one packaging engineer in cartons is very different for packaging engineers in plastics/glass etc. It's then very different if you work at a manufacturer as opposed to a retail brand.\n\nFor some companies packaging development is basic and requires some degree of packaging administration,  but for others it's much more advanced and more technical and experience is definitely needed. \n\nFor example I started as a Packaging design engineer in cartons (studied Packaging Design originally) and used to design box templates at a manufacturer. I then did a masters degree covering NPD and packaging development as I didn't want to be in the design space. Got a junior packaging development role, spent about 9 years as a packaging developer/packaging technologist (3 years at 3 brands), moved upto a Packaging Development Manager, and now a packaging consultant, generally specialising in all things cosmetics. Although I could work in food, I can expect that food would be a different ball game in some respect depending on the kind of food being sold.\n\nI don't really design these days, I more act as a technical expert, taking a brief or design concept for cosmetic brands and make it practical/feasible by working with my supplier network. I source/locate all kind of packaging options anything from bottles, jars, tubes, boxes, makeup packaging and more. Create timelines, review technical drawings, and act as the point of contact on all things packaging for brands (marketing, NPD, supply chain, founders etc) and packaging suppliers.\n\nThe packaging course is IOP/IOPP is definitely sufficient to get you into the game without spending big big money or years doing a degree, but then you need someone to give you an opportunity.   \nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

I'm looking for a site that customizes Photo Storage Archival boxes with printed lids instead of a fully custom box, as it's the right size and might be cheaper. I found a site called \"Bagsoflove\" that personalizes photo boxes with your image on the lid and allows you to choose the box color, which is what I want. However, their box is lined with fabric/suede, and I'm hesitant to buy it because I'm concerned the image might not turn out well on the felt material. If anyone knows of a website where I can get an image printed on the lid of a photo box for customization, please let me know! I've been searching but only finding boxes that aren't what I need, often wooden ones. Thanks!",

Previously, I just used stickers on a photo storage box, but I want something more attractive and unique (and permanent). I've explored websites that allow box design, but they typically require a minimum order, and I only need one. I found Vistaprint, but their sizes aren't adequate, even though they have a great design I like. The box size for the statue (with its protector) is 4.8\"L x 3.82\"W x 6.61\"H, and I'd need it larger to accommodate additional items like a collector's box. If anyone knows a site where I can order a single large custom box, please let me know! Thank you! (I'm new to this, so I apologize if my terminology is unclear.)",

These packaging materials are engineered to withstand the unique challenges of space travel, including extreme temperatures, vacuum conditions, and zero gravity. Astronaut packaging must also be lightweight, compact, and highly durable to protect delicate equipment, food supplies, scientific experiments, and other essential items during launch, transit, and in the harsh environment of space. Additionally, astronaut packaging often incorporates advanced technologies and materials to ensure the safety and functionality of payloads and crew members throughout the duration of the mission.",

This is my first warehouse job; I started as a night loader in 2020. From day one, I‚Äôve faced significant stress and problems that exceed my experience level. We handle soda, tea, water, beer, and wine, and the racking is not suited for the pallet sizes we use, causing substantial damage. Many racks lack guards, and there are dents at the bottoms, risking bolt failures. Additionally, many racks are missing anchors, and most are warped. Only 1 or 2 out of 20 aisles are straight enough to pass a string test. The narrow layout and back-to-back racking lead to collisions when using our standup lift, limiting our ability to maneuver. We can't sideload because the clearance is too short, and support beams obstruct some aisles. I need to replace and possibly reanchor some racking, but there are long rows that could stock 40 pallets each. Our fire suppression system is also affected, and I received conflicting advice on how to handle it. My supervisor suggested replacing it gradually, but this is a major project that could take months without halting operations. If OSHA inspected, they would likely shut us down, as the racking poses a significant danger to my team. I care about everyone's safety and would consider reporting to OSHA if necessary. Sorry for the lengthy message; I can provide more details if needed.",

The beams do give slightly, but again an expert will be able to tell you if you are within spec. If you have some heavier pallets of goods you should probably ensure the racks are rated for them. If not, you could direct with WMS or manually with your team that those pallets must be stored on the A level/floor locations within your rack. Unfortunately what you are dealing with is pretty standard for taking over a warehouse. If the previous regime looked the other way and did not address it typically just continues to get worse over time.",

Cloud options are often simpler to set up and maintain- this is ideal for anyone new to warehouse management.\n2. **Use barcode scanning:** It‚Äôs great that you want to use vendor barcodes! Many modern WMS solutions let you scan barcodes with a smartphone, so there‚Äôs no need to invest in extra equipment.\n3. **Focus on basic inventory tracking:** Start with the essentials like inventory counting, item locations, and simple order fulfillment. This will make it easier to manage items moving between the warehouse and the new storefront.\n4. **Catalog your existing inventory:** With a large inventory backlog, it‚Äôs worth organizing a thorough inventory count, even though it might take some time. \n5. **Look for mobile app support:** Choose a WMS that includes a mobile app. Scan items easily and get real-time updates as products move in and out.\n6. **Plan for growth:** While a basic setup is good to start, pick a system that can grow with the business‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre planning to open a storefront.",

        "content": "Starting warehouse management from scratch can feel overwhelming, especially with years of inventory to handle! Given your needs, here are some suggestions to help you set up a system that‚Äôs easy to manage and adaptable as your business grows:\n\n1. **Inventory Management Software**: Since user-friendliness is important, look into no-code platforms like **AppSheet**. I‚Äôve built similar systems for warehouse and inventory management, and AppSheet could be a great fit since it allows you to create custom applications without coding experience. You can easily set it up to track inventory by SKU, manage in/out transactions, and even integrate barcode scanning using your vendors‚Äô barcodes.\n2. **Getting Started with Barcoding**: Since you‚Äôll be using existing barcodes, look for software that supports barcode scanning natively or can integrate with mobile devices. AppSheet, for instance, has barcode scanning functionality, so you won‚Äôt need to re-tag each item.\n3. **Streamlining Inventory Setup**: Since you have a large backlog of products, it might be helpful to start with a phased approach‚Äîprioritize high-demand items or newer stock to get started. You can tackle the older items gradually as time allows. For your initial setup, you could also consider hiring a temporary helper for data entry, especially if you have hundreds of SKUs to catalog.\n4. **Tracking Inventory Across Locations**: Since you‚Äôll soon have both a warehouse and storefront, having a system with location tracking will help keep tabs on stock across multiple locations and prevent overselling. Look for software that lets you label or categorize items by location.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to explore the AppSheet approach, I‚Äôd be happy to share more details on setting up barcode tracking or inventory control. Wishing you all the best as you set up this new system!",

That's how I would do it. \n\nMy old job, we CC'ed monthly, and I've helped reset massive warehouse food storage. When moving from 1 physical warehouse to another, you really can't use wms to change bin or storage locations with a move function,  if you have that. It's mainly physical. Then obviously setup your wms to new loc's, etc after moved in.",

    "content": "As businesses expand, selecting the right software becomes crucial, particularly between Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). The key question is which to implement first: CRM or WMS? To decide, it's important to evaluate the benefits, challenges, and operational needs. \n\n**CRM vs. WMS: Key Differences and Benefits**  \n1. **CRM Benefits:** Salesforce data shows that CRM users experience a 29% boost in sales productivity. Forrester's study finds that 73% of companies regard CRM as vital for meeting customer experience goals.  \n2. **WMS Benefits:** Implementing a WMS can cut warehouse operations time significantly (2-6 times), with integrated order processing leading to a 25% productivity increase, 20% better space utilization, and 30% improved stock efficiency.\n\nPrioritizing a CRM system is advisable for enhancing sales and customer management. While a CRM streamlines sales and improves customer service, efficient warehouse operations are equally essential for timely service. \n\n**Evolving Solutions: From Basic Tools to Advanced Technology**  \nIf budget constraints limit immediate investment in a complete WMS, starting with basic inventory tracking tools like Excel can be an option. However, this method is prone to manual entry errors. As your business grows, automating processes becomes necessary. Utilizing barcode scanners and mobile devices can centralize data and boost efficiency. While handheld scanners using Excel have limitations, a system allowing multiple simultaneous scans can enhance workflow significantly.\n\n**CRM for Sales is as Essential as Cleverence for Warehouse Management**  \nIn sales, inefficient systems lead to frustration and reduced productivity. A well-automated CRM helps sales managers focus on selling rather than manual data entry. In warehouse management, relying on manual data entry can compromise data accuracy and visibility. A robust WMS should automate processes and integrate with ERP systems for real-time inventory insights.\n\n**Why CRM Comes First and WMS Follows**  \nInitially, a CRM is critical for nurturing customer relationships and driving sales. With a solid CRM foundation, you can then enhance warehouse efficiency. While traditional WMS solutions are effective, they can be costly and time-consuming to implement. Opting for a flexible, affordable solution like Cleverence allows for quicker implementation and better stock visibility without the expenses of conventional WMS. By implementing a CRM first and then adopting a system like Cleverence, you can manage both customer relationships and warehouse operations effectively.",

    "content": "Hello, we have a small warehouse for stock related to upcoming jobs, managed by one warehouse staff member. When equipment arrives, he retrieves a job folder, marks the delivered items on the quote, and labels each box with the quote number and job name. These items are then stored on shelves categorized by client. On installation day, our technicians collect the items marked for that job. This system has worked until now, but we have larger jobs requiring pallets of equipment for our audio-visual installations. We have reorganized our warehouse into bays (dexion) instead of simple A to Z shelves. We want to implement the following: 1. A system where incoming items can be logged by opening the quote, assigning a barcode, printing it, and scanning the item to mark it as received. Each quote can then be assigned to a specific bay (A, B, or C). We currently use Xero and can manually add quotes or items. 2. A floor plan layout accessible to the sales team, allowing them to hover over bay sections to see information like \"Bay contains quote 1234 - This client,\" possibly via an internal webpage or API displayed on an office screen. 3. The warehouse staff can prepare the gear by placing all outgoing items in a designated area and scanning them out as dispatched. Installers can then pick up all necessary items for the job. Does such an application exist? I'm looking for suggestions. I found some software called RightControl Lite but can't locate the developer's site, only third-party download links. Thank you, Damien.",

They are relatively affordable WMS and offer customization and a good onboarding service to set you off on a solid foundation. \n\nI've been in 3pl warehousing for 30 yrs and we've used everything from really expensive admin heavy systems to in house custom built applications.  Unless you have staff IT that can manage custom apps i would go with these WMS providers that are geared toward small to medium size businesses.  \n\nWhere you will potentially spend unnecessary money is trying to get that top view visual component. It's going to cost more than it's worth imo. Just create a map of the facility with your locations and have visual markings for all bin/bulk locations. Eventually the layout will be 2nd nature and a standard report be just as effective as your wms giving you some kind of top down visual representation. \n\nThere are multiple receiving processes but it sounds like you just need a basic license plate protocol where you assign PIDs (pallet id's or CIDs if you want to tag at the carton level) to each pallet and then associate those PIDs with a specific job or quote and then marry them to a location.  When it's time to pull the order you print a pick ticket, scan the pids as picked and staged in a staging location. Then scan them out for delivery when they leave. Your WMS will track the current status of each PID and can give you real time visibility of everything you have. \n\nAdded benefits are cycle count programs and inventory management processes that allows for self auditing to confirm all counts and locations. \n\nYou can make it as complicated as you want but essentially a good label printer (Zebra) and a cloud based WMS with some Android scanners off Amazon and you can manage anything you are describing here.",

This helps your warehouse staff to scan and assign items to individual projects efficiently. At any given time, it gives instantaneous visibility for the sales and the tech teams with what exactly is in each bay, all shown with a customizable visual floor plan. Accessing job and inventory data is also easy in IPIX because it uses an API for integration possibilities. This means you can set up internal screens or a server webpage to show inventory of each bay by client or job, enhancing communication and coordination. When it is time to send stuff out, that outgoing section lets your warehouse person \"prep\" gear and confirm each item is ready for pickup so that your techs can just scan and go. For your installation, IPIX [Warehouse Management Software](https://www.ipixtechnologies.com/products/warehouse-management-software) provides all the flexibility, automations, and visibility you may need to manage a fast-growing audio-visual inventory easily and efficiently.",

It goes up down left and right to adjust.\n\nIts easy to use, only goes up so high, so second level pallet would be fine for this, even 3rd or 4th level depending on your racking.\n\nIt works great on standard american pallets, forks are manually adjustable to width if you need to space them. Might need a rubber mallet to move them a little into the grooves.\n\nIts easy to operate and can either lock those untrained out with a key, or leave the key in for all to use.  \n\n\nhttps://www.raymondcorp.com/forklifts/stackers",

So if you are a Fortune 500 company, you should most likely not look beyond them.\n\nNetsuite and Microsoft Dynamics are really good ERP systems for mid-sized enterprises, and have light-weight WMS capabilities that you can use to manage most basic warehouse operations for inventory storage, order dispatch, picklist generation etc,\n\nHowever, if you are mid-sized enterprise or a 3PL then it gets tricky to find a real good WMS that have the depth of operational workflows to cater to most use-cases, are resilient and can handle exceptions really well.  \n  \nIn my implementation experience to date, I have really liked Shiphero for its usability, Hopstack for its flexibility, and have heard good things about Infoplus.",

We use several 203dpi Printonix T6204 printers with an inline barcode verifier that checks the barcodes on 4x6 labels for readability and breaks. These labels are for customer shipping. While we believe the barcodes are generally sufficient to prevent chargebacks, we do encounter some cases where automated systems struggle to read them completely, resulting in occasional chargebacks. We haven't received any evidence regarding label quality, and chargebacks are infrequent. However, we were warned that too many unreadable labels could lead to chargebacks for the entire order, regardless of what passes. We want to establish proof of label quality when they leave our warehouse to better contest chargebacks. I'm unsure how to find vendors that can integrate with our setup. Ideally, we seek a solution that grades the labels, reprints them if they fail, and maintains a record of their appearance at printing. Thank you for any suggestions.",

Instead of crossing your fingers and hoping it‚Äôs readable, you‚Äôll know right from the start that each barcode is crystal clear and scuff-free.\n2. **Automatic Reprints for the Tough Cases**: Got a label that doesn‚Äôt make the cut? PackageX can be set up to automatically reprint any label that‚Äôs not up to snuff. No more worrying if one slipped through with a faint barcode; it‚Äôll only send out labels that can stand up to even the strictest scanners.\n3. **Backup for Fighting Chargebacks**: And here‚Äôs the cherry on top‚ÄîPackageX can store a snapshot of every label. So, if there‚Äôs ever a chargeback threat, you have proof of exactly what that label looked like when it left your place. It‚Äôs basically a digital backup to keep you covered.\n4. **Fits Right in With Your Current Setup**: No need to toss out the tech you already use. PackageX‚Äôs system can work with all kinds of setups, so it‚Äôll likely fit in smoothly with your Printonix T6204s.\n\nAll in all, if you want a smoother shipping process and solid protection against chargebacks, PackageX can handle it! It‚Äôs like having a watchful eye over every label you send out, and that extra assurance can make a big difference.",

Those familiar with this type of scanner know the interface is poor and not user-friendly. I'm seeking a barcode scanner that transmits data via Bluetooth and includes a few buttons to send keypress events to the computer. My goal is to develop a program controllable by these buttons, allowing stockroom employees to interact entirely through the scanner with just a monitor. Does anyone know of a scanner that meets these requirements? I've found some scanners with keypads, but they seem limited to controlling onboard functions and can't communicate with connected devices.",

    "content": "I'm currently interning at a medium-sized bed manufacturing company, focusing on their Warehouse Management System (WMS). While I'm not a tech expert, I'm exploring how WMS can improve our chaotic warehouse, where items frequently go missing and processes are outdated. We have two warehouse employees and storage for about 1,900 pallets. I believe implementing barcode labeling and scanners, along with organizing the warehouse by SKUs, will enhance control over inventory. The company needs insights into product locations for better order picking and putaway, as well as data to optimize procurement, since many old items linger in storage. Currently, only two suppliers provide compatible barcodes, complicating inventory accuracy. Integration concerns with our existing ERP system, Exact Globe+, have led vendors to quote implementation costs between thousands to over 10,000 euros. I'm uncertain if implementation is necessary, as one vendor suggested using CVC files and an FTP server, which is outside my expertise. I'm also considering if a standalone WMS might be better. While WMS can improve inventory accuracy, it doesn't align well with our current practices, which involve writing off used goods during production. Our open warehouse policy leads to discrepancies due to items being taken freely. We don‚Äôt need all WMS features but want better control over our goods and procurement information. I'm unsure if barcode quality can be improved with printers and scanners, as we currently have only one scanner compatible with two suppliers. I see potential in a WMS solution, but I‚Äôm concerned about compatibility with our processes and the high costs involved, especially since the company has fewer than 100 employees. I'm seeking guidance to navigate this complex situation.",

        "content": "2000 pallets is probably manageable without a wms (not saying that one wouldn't be helpful of course)... depending on complexity of SKUs.. How many SKUs?\n\nFirst thing is that they would need to let go of their current way of doing things if they got a wms. 2 reasons. 1. If you keep doing things essentially the same way,  you probably aren't really improving,  so it will be extra work for little benefit . 2. Customising a WMS to act how you want it is expensive (for people who have many more than 2 warehouse employees).\n\nWith WMS you want to match the complexity to your business needs. Manhattan,  SAP EWM etc might be good, but they aren't for you . You will want some sort of SAAS. \n\nWith respect to cost. $10 000  is basically no money at all. If they aren't willing to spend it, they aren't nearly committed enough.  Similar deal with barcode scanners (which incidentally can usually be configured to read different barcode types). If they aren't willing to buy new devices,  they aren't committed enough. \n\nI'd feel out their level of commitment  before checking out SAAS WMS systems.  Do they have a budget in mind? \n\nMight be worth considering what other options you could have to manage the situation without a WMS. ERPs should help with stock planning.  Kanban might work for some items?\n\nFor storage management, a classic strategy is to have a prime/fixed/pick bin for each SKU (laid out so you can find it somehow), then any time you have extra stock that doesn't fit there you write its location number,  quantity and date on a little card that sits it a sleeve on the upright of the pick bin...If you need an item you only have to go to its pick bin, and you can see the list of everywhere that item is. You could do this without any software at all.  Maybe they need discipline more than they need a WMS?\n\nAnyway,  some considerations.",

Our operations are in a regulated environment concerning HazMat, food safety, and quality. We regularly handle rail, truck, and LTL shipments and send out LTL, FTL, FCL, and bulk. Where would be the best place to advertise this space? We can accommodate customers needing 2,000 to 50,000 sq ft, particularly in the food or water treatment sectors dealing with liquids or solids. We‚Äôve covered trade publications for food and water treatment; how can we connect with professional warehousers like brokers?",

Many applications to companies like Honeywell, Kimberly-Clark, and Bechtel Corporation have gone without updates for nearly two months. I feel lost lately, as it seems I'm just sending out applications without any feedback. I've reached out to recruiters and employees at these companies to network, but I often get no response.

Few tips off the top of my head:\n\n- show off numbers on it wherever you can\n- keep format simple\n- use action words to show what you‚Äôve driven\n- leave it in word doc format so algorithms can get it through the initial screening \n- ensure you show off that gps as it‚Äôs impressive \n- toss jobs req‚Äôs you want into worditout.com. Paste in the job posting ‚Äî> it‚Äôll show you most used words ‚Äî> plug those into your resume so algorithms have a higher shot of getting your resume to a recruiter \n- find your local ASCM or CSCMP chapter. Great networking opportunity and many local opportunities may arise from them\n\nBest of luck!",

Specifically, I'm exploring whether the trend of consumers choosing low-cost sites like Shein and Temu is affecting unethical practices in other organizations. I'm unsure which professions to target for my inquiries, so any guidance would be appreciated.

I live in Portland.  \n\nBackstory: In high school, I participated in a work-study program with internships and spent nearly three years at a global logistics company, where I found the data entry work unfulfilling. During my senior year, I interned in materials planning at an automotive manufacturer, but I felt lost as graduation approached. I chose to major in marketing, thinking it would lead to exciting opportunities at companies like Nike, but now I‚Äôm struggling financially while my tech friends are buying homes. \n\nAfter a year of reflection, I see no future in marketing. I currently enjoy a secure administrative job but want to engage my mind and earn more. I even returned part-time to my logistics job during college but messed it up during COVID and lost that opportunity. \n\nNow, I‚Äôm exploring supply chain roles and realize they might suit me, as I enjoy data analysis, problem-solving, and efficiency. I‚Äôm learning SQL and improving my Excel skills, which I believe would be beneficial in this field. The analytical aspect of supply chain excites me, and I feel it would align my skills with my interests. However, I‚Äôm uncertain if it‚Äôs too late to transition and if investing in certifications is a good idea. Any advice on whether supply chain would be a good fit or if these certifications are worth the investment would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

    "content": "Recent changes to Section 321 of the U.S. Tariff Act, which exempts low-value shipments from duties, have increased scrutiny on platforms like Shein and Temu. The U.S. government is tightening this rule to address the de minimis loophole that permits these companies to ship goods duty-free to American consumers. Understanding the broader context of U.S.-Mexico trade relations is vital, as Mexico has become an essential part of the American supply chain, especially amid the ongoing US-China trade war, which has spurred a nearshoring boom in Mexico. In 2023, Mexico overtook China as the U.S.'s top trading partner, with trade reaching $799 billion. This shift highlights changing supply chains, trade policies, and geopolitical dynamics in U.S.-Mexico relations.\n\nThe rise of maquiladoras in the 1960s marked the beginning, allowing Mexico to import raw materials duty-free for assembly and export finished products to the U.S., boosting border employment and reducing costs for U.S. manufacturers. NAFTA, enacted in 1994, further integrated North American supply chains by eliminating most tariffs, leading to U.S.-Mexico trade jumping from $81 billion in 1993 to over $614 billion by 2020. This agreement established a strong supply chain, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors, making the U.S.-Mexico border a vital production hub.\n\nDespite its advantages, NAFTA faced criticism over job losses and trade deficits, leading to its replacement by the USMCA in 2018, which introduced stricter regulations, periodic reviews, and updated labor and digital trade provisions for a more balanced trade relationship. Section 321 allows businesses to import low-value shipments (under $800) duty-free, facilitating cross-border trade and significantly boosting e-commerce along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has become ideal for fulfillment centers. However, this loophole has drawn criticism as many Chinese companies, including fast fashion brands like Shein and Temu, have exploited it, with reports indicating that nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. come from China.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war and COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains, prompting U.S. companies to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Mexico's proximity, trade agreements, and affordable labor have made it a preferred alternative, resulting in a nearshoring trend. Interestingly, some Chinese firms are establishing factories in Mexico to bypass U.S. tariffs, labeling goods as \"",

They bypass customs by going directly to the USA and clearing under the $800 de minimus value.\n\n1000s of products are consolidated into 40ft containers and shipped from China to the USA. However, since the products have already been purchased they can clear customs as individual packages (typically under $800) vs cleared as a container with all the products going to 1 buyer ($40k +)\n\nOther than that this is a great post!",

    "content": "I've made several decisions that seem detrimental to my career. I graduated in 2021 with a BA in Global Logistics Management and managed in retail for over six years. As I neared graduation, I received multiple internship offers from reputable companies in various sectors but chose to pursue a mortgage opportunity due to the appealing salary, despite noticing many warning signs. I now regret that choice, as I was laid off after a year. I used the layoff to fulfill my long-held dream of moving abroad with my family to study Spanish in Latin America. After returning nine months ago, I became disillusioned with job prospects in supply chain management and took a random job with the railroad. I initially thought re-entering the SCM field would be easy given the internships available post-college, but now I'm overlooked for better-paying roles. I'm uncertain about my interest in SCM since I've never worked directly in it, and I feel lost and unhappy about my next steps. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated.",

If that is basically correct, then you need to do three things to get some order into your life so you are not 'aimless'. There answer is in your comment: you need to aim at something so you need a target. And, my friend, you are going to have to work your arse off. \n\nThe problem is, you are not sure if the target you're aiming at is the one you want to hit. Let me tell you, there are lots of targets in life and achieving each one leads to setting the next target so stop thinking you need to nail it right the first time. \n\n1. Family budget: you cannot do anything until you have a transparent family budget. You MUST provide for your family so I suggest you head over to Dave Ramsey and use his plan and get yourself locked in. Also, if you can cut some costs out so you can take a lower paying role then that can help broaden your options\n\n2. If you have truely learned Spanish then use that to your advantage: be a manager that runs people in entry level roles whose mother tongue is probably Spanish e.g., warehouse manager. Alternatively, SALES. Yep, it's cliche but everyone needs a sales person and if you can get into sales in any career you can transition to other companies or into operations.\n\n3. Commit. You've followed your heart, now it's time to follow the path of being a provider, father and husband. Read 12 Rules for Life and Can't Hurt Me. They map it all out for you BUT you need to do the work.\n\nAll the best!",

Is this typical for new companies? Should I consider leaving? I've delayed signing any contract to avoid legal ties since they are new, and I want to protect myself. They source loads from DAT but also develop personal clients.",

        "content": "Risk management in supply chain in an emergency environment\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n1.Reseach Background:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMore and more companies are increasingly concerned about the rise of supply chain risks. Hence, understanding global supply chain risk management is vital and a top priority for both practitioners and academics. Many scholars revived interest in risk management, particularly in global supply chains. Hauer (2003) proposed that in today's increasingly complex environment, risk-adjusted supply chain management can translate into improved financial performance and competitive advantage.  A risk or disaster means any situation that occurs suddenly and whose influence may increase in intensity; it stops society from its traditional functioning and causes losses to life, the environment, and economies (Kƒ±lcƒ± et al., 2015, Kaur and Singh, 2019). Disaster management involves the fulfilment of some operations before and after the occurrence of a disaster to reduce its detrimental effects (Galindo and Batta, 2013, Oruc and Kara, 2018, Sarma et al., 2019). For example, COVID-19 is a disaster that hit the globe in late 2019 and has involved about 203 countries, affected more than 754,000 people, and taken the lives of about 36,500 individuals up to the end of March 2020. It has to mentioned that these statistics concern to the end of March 2020; significantly, the numbers of infected people and mortality rates change every day (WHO, 2020).\r  \n\r  \nThe global spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia has seriously influenced the main suppliers of intermediate products. With the duration and expansion of the epidemic affected, the production of global products has been affected by restrictions on population movements and transport control. At the beginning of the coronavirus, masks, disinfectant water and other hygiene products were exported in large quantities from China to the United States and Europe in March and April. The impact of the Coronavirus outbreak has been significant for the global transport industry. In the international transport of goods, the outbreak in many nations and the spread of the disease around the world have already had an impact on the global supply chain, with businesses shutting down, demand for shipping transport shrinking, and global shipping experiencing problems such as shrinking operations and backlogs of goods. This has made it difficult for these supplies to reach their destinations in a timely. Hence, it is vitally important to observe the entire supply chain, across all nations when choosing and implementing risk management strategies.\r  \n\r  \nSurprisingly, however, there is a lack of conceptual frameworks and empirical findings to provide clear meaning and standardising guidance on the phenomenon of global supply chain risk management. Many pieces of research ignore high‚Äêimpact, low‚Äêlikelihood risks. By understanding the variety and interconnectedness of supply chain risks, managers can tailor balanced, effective risk‚Äêreduction strategies for their companies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of risk management and risk management strategies in global supply chains.\r  \n\r  \n2.Research objects:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nGlobal supply chains are riskier than domestic supply chains due to numerous links interconnecting an extensive network of firms. These links tend to disruptions, breakdowns, bankruptcies, macroeconomic and political changes, and disasters leading to higher risks and making risk management difficult (Manuj and Mentzer,2008).\r  \nAlthough very important, risk management in the supply chain has not received lots of attention. Many strategies have been suggested, but there is little research focus on global supply chain especially in coronavirus epidemic. Recently, the world is faced with a contradiction between strong demand and insufficient supply. Besides, the import and export trade of many countries is affected. International logistics are severely affected, resulting in overcapacity for many producers, and agents and distributors are unable to receive goods in time, leading to short financial chains.\r  \nThis research will address this gap and provide some advice to the supply chain future development based on existing literature and qualitative research. This study will address several questions, firstly the types of risks in global chains and secondly how to choose the right strategy to deal with the risks in the chain in particular situations.",

Opt for the solution that grants you more control and saves costs at the same. In proactive VM, continuous contact is essential.  \nIf you want to propel vendors to deliver, make sure internal processes are smooth. With advanced vendor management software, businesses can achieve their goals at a lightning speed. Also, opt for a compliant vendor management solution that allows you to make periodic assessments and ensure there‚Äôs no risk attached to the industry standards.  \nIt is also vital to ensure supply chain continuity and resilience when you look for alternative vendor management plans. Risk management is another key consideration to select the best VM solution. Your objective should be to work side-by-side with vendors and mitigate risks. With regular performance evaluation and management of suppliers, you can resolve issues before they spiral out of control.  \nDespite what vendor management solution you choose, innovation should be at the center of it. In order to develop and grow in a competitive market, businesses need to embrace new technologies. Effective vendor management positions your business to leverage the benefits of the newest changes in the products or services.",

This decision is influenced by articles and videos he found online about the field, though he acknowledges he‚Äôs still unsure about the specifics of the day-to-day tasks and has come across conflicting information. While he knows it‚Äôs a broad area, he‚Äôs seeking insights into typical daily responsibilities. Will he primarily work on a computer? His grades in STEM subjects are good, but he dislikes them. He‚Äôs okay with using Excel daily, but if logistics and SCM roles require extensive math, programming, or number crunching for eight hours a day, he may reconsider. He would appreciate the opportunity to job shadow someone to gain more confidence in his choice, but we don‚Äôt know anyone in supply chain to ask. Any insights would be helpful.",

This is mostly what our projects consisted of. Creating spreadsheets from reports and maintaining some basic KPIs. \n\nOther day to day things are included identifying parts shortages and cutting new POs (which we all had to calculate new usages based on historical data), creating production schedules based on parts on hands and labor allocation. In our situation, we are constantly under pressure to keep the supply chain flowing. \nIt‚Äôs definitely not easy. Again, this is a small company with no true MRP system and a very fast paced environment. \n\nI have other friends who have similar roles in much larger companies that have vastly different day to day tasks. \n\nIf he does not like math and science, or would like to be behind the computer screen all day (periodically), I would personally not recommend this field.",

    "content": "I'm new to Excel and studying core business courses with a focus on SCM. I'm participating in a mobile game mini-event for the next 5 days, and I'm interested in optimizing inputs as a learning exercise. The game simulates a three-stage retail business: a farm producing wheat, a baking station making cakes, and a store selling cakes for coins, which can be used for prizes. The farm generates 16 wheat every 10 seconds, increasing by 1 wheat daily. The baking station has \"employee cards\" that convert a certain amount of wheat into cakes every 10 seconds. Although I didn't input data into Excel from the start, here are the cards with their ratios and percentages, which remain constant while their output increases as they level up. You can draw once daily, and which cards to upgrade is based on luck. Only one character can occupy a slot at a time. \n\n| Left align        | Center align      | Right align      |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Pota lvl.4       | 4 wheat / 8 cakes| 50%              |\n| Bunny Woo lvl.4  | 8 wheat / 12 cakes| 67%              |\n| Dana lvl.5       | 15 wheat / 20 cakes| 75%              |\n| Meles lvl.4      | 20 wheat / 20 cakes| 100%             |\n| Bunny Lan lvl.4  | 28 wheat / 24 cakes| 117%             |\n| Nichol lvl.4     | 40 wheat / 36 cakes| 111%             |\n| Atar lvl.3       | 27 wheat / 24 cakes| 113%             |\n| Balu lvl.5       | 40 wheat / 35 cakes| 114%             |\n\nThe \"retail\" station and \"employee\" cards convert cakes into coins every 10 seconds, with leveling also dictated by luck. The ratios and percentages remain unchanged, but output increases. Coins are used for items in the temporary event store, with one character per slot:\n\n| Left align        | Center align      | Right align      |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Rota lvl. 4      | 3 cakes / 9 coins| 33%              |\n| Pari lvl. 5      | 10 cakes / 25 coins| 40%              |\n| Mujia lvl. 4     | 12",

This is done with a hydraulic loading platform attached to the truck. The agent moves the cargo manually using a small platform with castor wheels.\nUsually the agent has a load plan I.e how the artwork will be loaded onto an aircraft pallet otherwise our warehouse staff will direct them where to place it. Once the cargo is positioned we will strap and net the cargo securing it for travel.\n\nFreight with wheels is much harder to secure as it is more likely to move in transit. There is normally friction between the cargo and the aircraft pallet/shoring which helps prevent movement. Strapping and nets do the rest. Having cargo on wheels means that friction is gone and extra strapping is required in multiple directions.",

So you scan in the items at the time of receiving, and also can while putting them away in specific locations. This way you have the digital footprint of what was received, and added to inventory. Similarly, on the outbound side, you can scan the items out against the order/pick ticket so you will have a complete digital footprint of the IN & OUT movements.\n\nNow during the stock take, your software ideally should have a mobile app that allows you to create a cycle count plan either instantaneously, or scheduled at pre-defined intervals. The plan should let you do a digital scan of inventory by SKUs and locations or both. The scanned quantities against a plan should then compare the inventory against the previous record of inventory in the system, and show you the discrepancies, along with options to do necessary adjustments. We do this using our software (Hopstack)",

We've faced issues with high staff turnover, and recently, we've found significant inventory missing, leading to discrepancies. I suspect theft might be involved, but I‚Äôm unsure if current employees are responsible. I've been trusting and somewhat hands-off, resulting in losses of tens of thousands of dollars. What tips do you have for sorting through the data to determine if this is a data error or actual loss? Should I announce the theft issues to raise awareness or investigate quietly? The warehouse supervisor, who may be involved, continues to work without concern about the missing items. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "Use an inventory tracking or warehouse management system. A lot of times, when you're starting off or are a small business, the ROI in granularly tracking every single item doesn't really justify the effort and cost involved. But if the cost of theft is significantly higher than what you can potentially save by putting in the effort of tracking every single piece of item through a proper system, that's where I would start.\n\nOne of the things that you can implement is having item-level barcodes, if you don't have it already. Scan the item in and scan it out through a proper inventory management or warehouse management system. Ensure that every movement of that inventory, whether it's moving from one location to another or from the bulk storage area to the fulfillment area, is tracked via scan-in and scan-out.\n\nInstitute a proper cycle count process, which is an audit process. Ensure that the system you choose or are using also has a built-in functionality for cycle counts, where you can go through the counting of inventory on a frequent basis. Since currently, you're facing this theft problem, I would recommend having the cycle count at a slightly higher frequency, perhaps once every month, or even more frequent if needed. Once you start to get a better handle on this inventory discrepancy issue, you can reduce the frequency of your cycle counts to perhaps once a quarter, or something like that. Instituting this process and standard operating procedures will at least send the message within your team that there's now a proper tracking system. This change in itself might deter any internal theft if it's occurring. However, even if you do all of this, there might still be a chance of theft. But unless you start patting employees down like airport security, which I wouldn't recommend as it creates a low-trust environment, it's about finding a balance.\n\nI would start with implementing a proper inventory tracking or warehouse management system, barcoding SKUs and every item if possible, tracking the movement of every location through scan-in and scan-out, and instituting a frequent cycle count or SKU audit process",

Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Cycle Counts: Start with regular cycle counts, focusing on high-value or high-turnover SKUs. It‚Äôll help you quickly identify any patterns or discrepancies.  \n\n2. Audit the Process: Look at your data entry and inventory processes to see if there is room for manual errors. Sometimes, software misalignment or manual adjustments can also cause issues.\n\n3. Introduce Tracking & Automation: Automated systems like ASRS can help by tracking each item‚Äôs movement and reducing the need for manual counting, which often helps prevent both theft and errors.\n\n4. Communicate Carefully: Rather than announcing outright suspicions, you might consider framing it as a routine process improvement. That way, you can gather insights without creating defensiveness.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck sorting it out!",

Since we've already paid for the vendor parts, why does the company charge us for unused inventory we've already settled?",

My boss creates random \"part numbers\" in QuickBooks, sometimes forgetting how he named them. My question is: Is there a program that allows me to scan the original UPC label on an item and have it display the product name he used in QuickBooks instead of the UPC numbers? For instance, when I scan a UPC for glasses, the computer shows the UPC numbers, but I want it to display \"Polarized Safety Glasses Black Frame.\" I want the scanner to function as a keyboard without interacting with QuickBooks. I know I can create my own barcodes that correspond to custom names, but is there a way to have the original UPC display text instead? My boss likely won't agree to re-label items with new barcodes. Sorry if this question is unclear.",

Our current price list is scattered across hundreds of Excel files created by my father, which is inefficient. When a client asks for a price, I have to manually search through these files without a centralized system, making it difficult to keep everything updated and often requiring extra trips to the office for information. Each file contains the item name, photo, description, and price. While we don‚Äôt sell online, we do list most items on our website. I'm looking for software to simplify this process. It should: serve as a price list for product info and prices, have a hierarchical menu for categories, support formatted text (especially tables), be mobile-friendly, generate QR codes for easy access to item info, include photos, and allow easy export for website upload. I've tried Sortly, but it lacks formatted text options, and Odoo seems too complex. I need something simple that older staff can use, as I‚Äôll be the one updating it and training them. Has anyone encountered a similar issue? Any suggestions for a simpler solution? Thank you!",

Same thing when it is returned.\n\nTake a look at this video for ideas.\n\n[https://youtu.be/GxO2SvlUHj8?si=y8A4QN4HVwjulXq-](https://youtu.be/GxO2SvlUHj8?si=y8A4QN4HVwjulXq-)\n\nThis might be an interim solution, but more importantly it will force the current inventory to be counted and tagged. Then, you might move to a paid app that does more, but also has a monthly fee.",

        "content": "Hey there! That sounds like quite the task, especially with a 30k sqft facility and no current system for labeling or tracking inventory. Managing large volumes of furniture and d√©cor manually using Excel and paper tags is a challenge‚Äîespecially as your space grows or becomes more dynamic.\n\n\n\nSince you‚Äôre in need of an interim solution before rolling out a full ERP, you might want to consider using a more automated inventory management system that can quickly tag and track furniture pieces. I‚Äôve seen some teams switch to using mobile scanning apps with QR codes or RFID tags to streamline this. This kind of solution can work well to track not just the current location of items but also their status‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre in use, reserved for a model, or ready for reallocation.\n\n\n\nIn terms of organizing your space, setting up aisle and bin labels will definitely help, especially if you pair it with a digital system that visually maps where each item is stored. AI-based tools are now making it easier to organize warehouses by generating efficient storage recommendations based on usage data, size, and frequency of access‚Äîthis could be helpful when stacking large furniture that‚Äôs hard to view at a glance.\n\n\n\nI've come across some solutions that integrate inventory tagging and tracking with order fulfillment, and they‚Äôre really effective in eliminating manual errors while boosting efficiency. If you‚Äôre interested, I can share more about how AI is being used in inventory management for similar industries and how it could apply to your warehouse.\n\n\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to dive deeper into this‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to chat and explore options that might work for your specific needs!",

For context, my company uses QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise for bookkeeping and operates a WooCommerce website integrated with QB for invoicing. While this setup works reasonably well, managing inventory is challenging. Currently, inventory is tracked through QB upon invoicing, but receiving and counting are done manually. I believe a barcode system would greatly improve our pick/pack and inventory processes, yet QB Desktop appears limited in inventory functionality. Should we switch to a different software entirely, or is there a lightweight scanning solution that integrates well with QBD? Thank you!",

    "content": "We sell on Amazon, Shopify, and primarily eBay. We use Nembol to sync stock levels, which effectively imports products from eBay and manages stock. We also sell directly via invoice, so that process needs to be simple. For stock management, we use Google Sheets with a formula that updates when staff enter an SKU or asset tag while packing orders. Since we mainly sell laptops, it would be helpful to filter stock by specific attributes, including items not ready for sale due to repairs. Currently, stock checks are manual and challenging, so we're looking for solutions that could ease this process and possibly include a pick list. Any recommendations? Thank you!",

The solution was to create a new database, populate it with sample data, launch and stop the server, and then import the existing database.

I've been unexpectedly assigned to set up a warehouse management system (WMS), and I feel under-qualified and overwhelmed by the information I've found. One important requirement is that items should only be removed from the inventory once a delivery receipt is attached. Can anyone suggest a preferably free WMS software that meets this need? I'm looking for a system that can manage inventory, fulfill orders, and ideally handle shipping. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "Are you stuck with Odoo? I would not recommend it for any inventory management or MRP uses. \n\nStory Time: Around 3 years ago, a startup hired me to implement Odoo MRP at their site. Their engineering team chose the software because it hooked up to their PLM. I have implemented other mid-size MRPs, so I know what they are supposed to be able to do. The company had already financially committed to Odoo, so I did my best to make it work.  The tool was completely lacking basic MRP features. I worked on it for 6 weeks before I urged the complany to abandon Odoo and try another tool. Eventually, they had to take legal action for a partial refund.\n\nThe main problem: \n\nWhen running MRP you normally expect to put in a few parameters - time, warehousing locations to include, etc - and get a list of items that will fall short at some point in your time range so you can mitigate the issues. In Odoo (3 years ago), you were required to input an item for Odoo to reply with whether it would be short. The user input was me telling Odoo what items to look at instead of Odoo telling me what items were in trouble.\n\nAdditional complaints:\n\nAt the time there was no way to set Odoo to disallow negative inventory quantities. When I asked about it they said we could download open source add-ons or hire someone to develop that feature for us. Nonnegative inventory is one of the most basic inventory settings I can think of.\n\nI repeatedly asked Odoo for references of ANY other manufacturing customers that were using Odoo so I could discuss how they were solving specific issues (since Odoo was unable to answer my questions). They would say yes and then never deliver. I swear I asked 10 times.\n\nOdoo would not give me a chart of their data tables or a way to export data.\n\nThe reporting options were atrocious. They couldn't even show me how to make a basic phone list from the user table.\n\n  \nTLDR: I looked at Odoo in depth 3 years ago. They sold a half-baked product and evaded any questions that highlighted this fact. Whether or not the MRP module has improved since then, I would not consider Odoo again due to this experience.",

I've been tasked with managing inventory across various stores in our retail chain after starting in a management role. Despite conducting multiple inventories over the past six months, we haven't achieved accurate ERP inventory levels. The main challenge is that we conduct inventories while stores are open, section by section, which can't be changed. My boss expects accurate stock, but I‚Äôm struggling to achieve this quickly. My current strategy includes: - Recently completing an inventory in our stores. - Assigning each store manager to perform daily inventory checks at two locations, ensuring rotation and identifying discrepancies. I hope this leads to improved accuracy in future counts, with discrepancies then linked to product loss or unlogged operations in the ERP. What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you think it will enhance stock accuracy, or can you suggest a better method based on your experience?",

For instance, within 6-12 months you need to get around to and cycle count all the items in the store. Not just the same ones.\n\nWhat I would do in that instance, is pull a 12 month sales report by item and classify the fastest movers with the most volume to be counted the most frequenty. Maybe daily or weekly. Then on down from there. The slowest moving item may get counted once or twice a year.\n\n100% accuracy is just not realistic in ANY inventory I've been around. One of the issues is, I've never seen 100% anywhere. And if you put it on a chart, the cost starts going up dramatically the closer you want to be near 100%. If you're storing gold bars, fine, but on socks with shrinkage maybe not so much? See?",

Because they're so specific to the client's unique requirements, it wouldn't be possible to sell them to anyone else without major modifications either.\n\nAnother reason clients come to me is because of gaps that exist in the ERP/MRP they might be using. I plug those gaps by automating manual processes that must be carried out in individual situations that those larger systems simply do not cover.\n\nAnother reason a custom solution might make sense is if you're not terribly keen on spending bucket loads of money for features you will never need, and instead would like something that simply does what you want for much less than a larger and more complicated system will cost you.",

    "content": "I recently began tracking productivity at a steel fabrication shop where bulk steel beams and sheet metal are turned into construction components at various stations (saw, plasma cutter, welding, finishing, etc.). We currently estimate production time by comparing when workers clock in at a station to the number of parts processed during a shift, but this method lacks accuracy for specific parts. I want to implement a system that tags each part with a barcode, allowing it to be scanned in and out at each station during processing. Is there a low-cost software app that can generate barcodes for printing and enable time logging with handheld or cell phone scanners, capturing the station data? I believe this tracking method is common, but I'm unsure where to find it and hope it's not too expensive. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

We have a main warehouse and potentially another for job sites, and we need to track stock transfers and item adjustments when sending out tools and consumables.

You can also use dedicated barcodes that include quality assurance processes or referencing a manufacturing process. \n\nRegistered barcodes - common barcodes you register in places for things like Amazon (global standard barcodes) and for sharing with retailers who resell your products.

You should have 3 parts available per week for 12 weeks. So the safety stock level should be 36 units in inventory. \n\nIt means you should keep your minimum inventory level for this item at 36 units and order it again when it hits that balance or before hitting that balance. \n\nSo the most important thing is to understand consumption rates per week and multiply it by lead times to determine how much inventory you need to keep in order to satisfy demand and reduce lead time to end customers",

So, a safe starting point could be 12 weeks of inventory.\n\n\t2.\tSafety Stock calculated based on the standard deviation of your lead times and demand.\n\n\t3.\tDemand Forecasting using historical sales data, seasonal trends, and any other relevant factors will help you maintain appropriate inventory levels.\n\n\t4.\tKanban Sizing: The size of your Kanban should be based on the consumption rate and the lead time. A simple formula for Kanban size is:\n\nKanban Size = Daily Usage √ó (Lead Time + Safety Factor)\n\nThis ensures you have enough parts to cover consumption during the replenishment cycle.\n\nDid you try to implement something like this?",

For example if you make shit out of raw steel all day every day, you might get sheets and coils of steel daily or several times a day. But an ABC analysis might have you turning A items twice a month, C items 4 or 5 times a year.

    "content": "Last week, DAT informed my boss about transferring our company on November 17. They executed it an hour ago; I was first, followed by my boss 15 minutes later. I had seen this coming and logged out immediately each time. I convinced myself it wasn‚Äôt real and held onto hope until the end. I only had one truck left for Sunday and was casually looking at loads for Monday, booking a few. But then I encountered the awful web design‚Äîa frustrating, unintuitive interface that required extra clicks, displayed only five searches at once, and blocked other posts with blank space when viewing comments. The \"book now\" button took up twice the space of the email area, making it hard to see the email without right-clicking. I couldn‚Äôt block Canadian loads by default and had to do it for each shipment, and duplicating searches was impossible. The alert sound was dreadful. After accessing my Truckstop account with another company, I was shocked by how much better it was. Sorry, Truckstop, for not realizing how user-friendly you were. The lag was unbearable, freezing ten times in 30 minutes as I struggled to comprehend the logic behind this abomination. I booked a random load, told my boss I couldn‚Äôt handle this nightmare any longer, and went to the bar. I‚Äôll probably call my boss tomorrow to show him Truckstop. I know it has fewer loads for dry vans, but that might not last. I‚Äôm still having flashbacks and trying to accept this new tool; only swearing comes to mind as I grapple with my new reality. Happy Friday, everyone, and have a good weekend. I've attached a picture of my first drink tonight; I don‚Äôt understand why they served Metaxa in two glasses when I‚Äôm alone‚Äîmaybe they thought someone had passed away.",

Your new role would be to keep bringing in freight for the assets and start pulling in freight to broker. You‚Äôre the sole account manager for any account you land, and for brokered freight, you‚Äôre the customer- and carrier-side load manager. No billing, compliance, or management duties. \n\nForget percentages. Don‚Äôt let them trick you into selling, managing accounts, AND operating brokered loads. As you land more accounts, you spend more time managing the accounts and operating loads, so you sell less and less, until you have no time to sell. You can barely quote and cover all the loads and still keep your customers happy, so landing another account is a nightmare. Your income stagnates. \n\nI wrote that like a horror story but if you can sell, it‚Äôll happen. So keep the base and percentage, maybe try bumping up to 3% or 4% but more importantly make them agree to hire an operator once you hit a certain (LOW) monthly load count.\n\nPitch it like an investment, they‚Äôre agreeing to buy back your time at a certain point so you can keep growing their revenue. Not even a big investment, broker ops you basically need a high school diploma and know how to email.",

Despite including details in the rate confirmation, discussing them over the phone, and sending follow-up emails, I still have to fine about one in every 15 loads. Why is it so difficult to call and report a problem? Just communicate, and there won't be an issue. Instead, I learn about delays or no-shows from my client. I only discover issues like missing scale tickets or incorrect blind deliveries when I receive the invoice. These are all solvable with effective communication. I'm also interested in what fines other brokers impose for late deliveries or poor communication, as well as for late or missing paperwork.",

Because I want carriers available to do my loads, and I don't want them clucking at the truck stop about how I rip them off and not to work with me. Also, if I clip the wrong one they'll file on my bond, and then a bunch of people in the company have to do work to prevent paying out, which costs way more than I made off the fine.\n\nConversely, the best punishment is to put the carrier on the do not use list and tell them politely or otherwise to fuck off when they call. If I really want to be shitty I'll FreightWatch them and they can explain to the world why they don't suck.\n\nBut really? Shit happens, stuff goes wrong, windshield jockeys do windshield jockey shit and it's not worth the static or the bad reputation to hit their pockets constantly.\n\nNow if they cost me money with their craziness? I definitely hit them for every penny it cost me plus an asshole tax, and that's why that stuff is really in the rc, so I have that option.\n\nOther than that? They're out there trying to make a living, and I don't take food off people's plates without a strong reason.",

For example, if we project 50 loads over six months, the rebate levels would be: 3% for 38 loads, 2% for 25 loads, and 1% for 15 loads. At the end of the six-month RFQ period, you would pay the rebate based on the actual loads tendered. Would this interest you in securing my business? We apply this approach in purchasing and sales, but I haven't used it in transportation before.",

This isn't common in transportation though as margins are pretty tight and trust is in very short supply.\n\nWhether this rebate will be tolerable to a vendor is going to be based on whether or not the rate they offered you makes sense after paying the rebate.\n\nIf I saw this rebate program on something I was bidding I would just add 4% to every single lane immediately. You can do anything you want, but the way people react to it (especially something that isn't standard to transportation like this) is going to be to raise your prices by more than it could possibly cost them.\n\nHonestly in trucking it usually works the other way. Someone moves more volume for you they get more money per move not less (you're paying them for the convenience of not having to find one new vendor per load which is the \\*default\\* in trucking, which is why freight brokerages exist int he first place). Right now the gap between contract rates and spot rates is in the 15-20% range on a lot of lanes lol.",

Lauderdale to Maine that wouldn't be ready for a few days, also oversized. The broker who sent me to Stuart asked if I could drop that load and take one back to Oregon in 5 days. I agreed and checked with the customer, who wasn't happy but understood. I found a suitable carrier at my quoted price, and everything seemed fine. However, on day 5, as I drove toward the shipper, the broker called to say the load wouldn‚Äôt be ready for another 3 days and offered a rate increase. I had to stay in a hotel since I was in a triple axle day cab. After 8 idle days, the shipper informed me the load wouldn't be ready for weeks. I had to rush back west for another load from Washington on a Friday, missing out on other opportunities. I lost a $28,000 rate confirmation and had to drop a $16,000 load while waiting. Filing on bonds typically leads to the same response: ‚Äútake it to court, and if you win, we‚Äôll pay,‚Äù but nothing was hauled, just lost chances and extra costs. When this happens with a broker, do you usually block their number and send a middle finger emoji? Lawsuits are difficult, but it's hard to stay in business with brokers like this. I'm curious how others have dealt with similar situations. Thanks for reading.",

I get it, better money is always better money, but not at the expense of pissing off a customer. Had the first load been crap or a nightmare shipper then you have a point on why you dropped it. Doesn't really matter, but people who give out cheap freight expect things like that sometimes. Anyway, you can't do anything about waiting for 5 days, the extra 3 days is also on you because again, you waited. You could ask for a TONU but thats peanuts compared to the rate con. IMO, this is all on you. Choose better brokers and for sure stick with a good paying load. Had you of went with what you booked you wouldn't have sat idle for 8 days then deadhead to Washington.........",

I've worked in 9 or 10 different carriers as a dispatcher before I opened my own company  and the real breakdown rate varies. It's as high as 33% in some shittier carriers with older equipment and the cheapest drivers they  could find to as low as 10% with brand new Ryder / Penske leases that you get a \"sub-unit\" if you break down and keep driving. Also special note for reefers - Carrier units are completely disgusting and MAGNITUDES worse than Thermo King. Unfortunately they are prevalent since they are cheaper. \n\nSo why do we lie? Sometimes the driver fell asleep. The worst thing you can do is wake him up and push him to drive . That's how accidents happen. Dumb dispatchers and greedy company owners will do that, but I'm not that piece of shit and I don't want my drivers to plow through 7 cars full of people. And none of the drivers under my dispatch ever had for 13 years. But I've seen some of the drivers of my former coworkers do that and I don't want to have that on my conscious. \n\nOther times we the driver has irregular bowel movements. Another time we use breakdown as an excuse to cancel a load. Or the driver has an actual emergency. Or his medical expired and we can't put him on a load. Or his CDL got suspended. It's just better to tell you we had a breakdown than to explain the BS we deal with. Just like you tell us \"the customer covered it\" while in reality you never had the load to begin with, moved it cheaper or it got rescheduled - it's not worth the hassle to explain yourself.",

This cycle has certainly been challenging. I was just reminiscing with someone about 3-4 years ago when it was typical to gain 3-5 customers monthly, sometimes even up to 10 with enough effort. This year, I've been averaging two clients per month, despite cold calling extensively without the desired success. We‚Äôve managed to grow about 5% this year, so I can't complain too much. I'm hopeful that next year will make client acquisition easier, but we‚Äôll see. I believe there‚Äôs always new business to be found, regardless of the economy. How has your experience been with acquiring new clients?",

The supply chain crisis caused by COVID meant that there was a ton of urgency to get things moving as companies returned to full production. But it was never going to last after things stabilized. Brokers and carriers that made it through COVID benefited because so many others shut down. But customers wised up after the initial surge of giving out freight to pretty much anyone at any cost. And I think that even if the market is truly rebounding, it'll be a long time before we see margins like we did in 2021-2022.",

If the credit isn't at least workable they need to pay in advance or it isn't a real customer and could be a scam like this.\n\nIf this is a massive account with good credit that has legitimate disagreements about the invoices in question that's obviously very different... but that's not how you worded this OP and the last thing you're describing is the act of a scumbag trying to pop smoke and run with your money.

How do you find brokers with established accounts? What strategies attract them to your team? What qualities should you seek in employees 2, 3, and 4 to build a strong foundation? I‚Äôm not recruiting‚Äîjust looking to learn from your experiences and effective strategies. Thank you for sharing! ‚Äì Jason",

        "content": "Hey Jason! I was a broker for 6/7 years and left the industry recently. Like many other fresh grads I started at the big company in Cincinnati. When I left and switched to a new brokerage I was looking for a few things. I wanted to see my weekly, monthly, yearly commission statements in a timely manner. I didn‚Äôt want to worry getting nickeled and dimed to death about this customer gets this % this customer gets this %. I wanted a flat % on every load I moved. I didn‚Äôt want to worry about people stealing my customers. I wanted the control to pick and choose my carriers and not worry about them getting black balled by another broker. The brokerage in Cincinnati let‚Äôs people go every single day. If your not afraid of their non compete just watch the linkendin posts of people recently getting laid off. They might not have a big book of business but they are at least trained. You can also offer a % 1099 agent split but most agent programs are 50-70%. Can you also offer the back end supports established agents would be looking for? Just food for thought. Also could look up guys that there companies have closed down and are looking for a new home. Other way to recruit is recruit a brand new kid just graduated, train them the way you want them to handle your current business, and then grow your business by you your self spending more time selling. Just food for thought",

FedEx hasn't let me down before, but I recently faced a simple shipment from Washington State to Colorado that cost $933 in freight but had an additional $820 in charges. This included a $327 reweigh fee, even though the origin isn't the shipper and they have a signed scale ticket. They benefit from accurate weights, and I confirmed they have loading docks after calling. Yet, I was hit with a $195 origin limited access charge and a $265 destination limited access fee, despite there being ample room for larger trailers. I've never encountered such charges before; I've only faced overlength fees previously. Watch out for FedEx's pricing practices, as UPS/T-Force hasn't charged me this way.",

Both times it was something like $100 fine on NJ-NY run that was only a few hundred to begin with. I have also had them stick a limited access charge. Only other carrier to do that unexpectedly was Estes and it was a literal bee hive farm on a dirt road so it felt fair. Tforce is definitely the worst and pickiest about it in my (limited) LTL experience, but always the cheapest. As RR and Estes lately get more competitive though FedEx makes less and less sense.\n\nThey should provide you with their own certified scale weight and signed internal measurements they took if you ask. If the variance is somewhat small, a certain level of rep can reduce or waive it. I never book direct with them, always through an volume-discount agent that can fight these wars for me.",

For the past nine months, I've generated over $60,000 a month in gross profit at 30% margins, managing all shipments myself. However, the company won't hire help for tasks like load coverage and check calls. As a result, I'm leaving an additional $40,000 in gross profit on the table each month due to time constraints. I've requested assistance for my accounts multiple times, but instead, they hired eight sales reps who were all let go for failing to acquire customers. I've highlighted that my clients are major industry players willing to connect me with more freight, but I need time to prospect. They have denied my requests for equity, assistance, or a raise, even though my accounts represent 80% of the company's total gross profit. When should I consider taking my accounts and leaving?",

    "content": "We onboarded a new customer selling saunas directly to consumers. Their crates measure 40 inches long, 80 inches wide, 90 inches tall, and weigh 1,500 lbs. Since the company is small, they requested the most affordable delivery option. I suggested using box trucks with liftgates, allowing the driver to use a pallet jack to deliver to customers' homes. Today, our first truck was dispatched, but the driver reported insufficient clearance to access the liftgate for delivery (residential area, no forklift available), so we canceled the truck. The yellow circled areas made it impossible for the driver to reach the liftgate. I realize I made a mistake, and now my customer is seeking another delivery solution for these crates. What would be a suitable alternative? Thank you, and please keep feedback constructive.",

But based on consumer debt, spending patterns, and the overall state of the economy I don't see anything lining us up for anything spectacular happening in terms of a boom.  I just don't see any evidence indicating we will see anything but consolidation for the near future.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/806pn68x1izd1.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2cad74ca934fe2afab3b2a9595d6fd30996be7b",

It wouldn't matter if you had 20+ years prior but then you were going through a medical or family situation causing you to take a break, or you went to work under another company for a while but you decided to go back to being a normal O/O.\nFact is the MC you're presenting to us is too new since it's reinstatement date only. And we are all funds on hand, no credit debt payors with the top scores amongst the carriers factoring companies because we pay out on time, every time. There is no waiting for our clients to pay their invoices. We pay you first and recoup it from our clients.\nI worked elsewhere before (terrible place) where they had almost no carrier compliance rules - if one certain person said that MC is fine, we were to use them, but if something went wrong, we had to pay out of pocket ourselves for doing what we were told to do. \nRide it out, man. Try direct contract freight or direct shippers who may utilize brokers and carriers via load lists. Yes, it'll suck, but it's only 3 months. Then you can get in with the better shippers and real brokers.",

The reefer was set to 34 degrees, with return control between 32 and 37 and discharge control between 24 and 34. Additionally, the BOL clearly states the product was rejected due to ‚Äúinsect damage,‚Äù not frost. Two pallets were rejected, and the warehouse retained the rest. It has been two weeks, and they have not provided evidence of frosting. The delivery was made to Kroger, which states the BOL's reason for rejection is the only one that matters. The broker insists the issue is frost and a carrier claim. We believe we are not at fault, yet the broker seems intent on blaming us to withhold our payment. What are our options to recover our funds?",

Trust me Insurance will find every reason to deny coverage and they will have to make up the case with insurance and all have to prove it is a frost issue and if not the insurance will shut them down. As soon as they do that, file on their bond for the load amount and tell them to go F themselves and that you will settle this for court as BOL shows it is insects not frost. They don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on at Court, show the  temp recorder and BOL and trailer last inspection that is free of holes\n\nIf they threaten you with a Freight Guard, make sure to record all call conversations and emails and sue them for defamation and remind them that freight guards now aren‚Äôt removable and that you will sue for every penny in lost revenue for unlimited time as a result of their fraudulent report and enjoy sleeping and banking on their idiocy. \n\nScumbags brokers like that want to blame it at you because they don‚Äôt have a backup insurance so they basically are screwed. They need to understand that in trucking it is all about risk, if you aren‚Äôt taking risk, why are you getting a cut of the freight bill when you have no skin.\n\nIf it was one of the good brokers, there are in tough sport and they will most likely be fired by the customer as they won‚Äôt be able to pay them back the lost damage that god knows how it was infested at the shipper or even at manufacturer but hey it is trucking every day super risky business in an unsustainable model.",

I have several documents: 1) a signed contract agreement between us acting as a bill of lading, 2) a fraudulent check for the payment amount, 3) text messages and call recordings where he promised to pay upon delivery, and 4) state troopers who intervened during delivery, forcing us to accept the check instead of cash with their body cams recording.

In the scenario where a broker gives a load to a fraudulent carrier, who then hands it off to a legitimate one, the fraudulent carrier can collect payment and vanish without compensating the actual carrier. However, could this be easily prevented by double-checking? For instance: 1. The shipper verifies the expected carrier against the one that arrives; if they don't match, the shipper withholds the load. 2. Alternatively, the driver could confirm with the shipper about the expected carrier to ensure they are authorized. Problem resolved?",

He is seeing things like freight diverted, transloaded, & exported in a matter of days after a theft. The FMCSA is working to add multi-factor authentication. Loadboards are investing a ton on this too. Ultimately, it means more intrusive technologies & more expensive stuff. \n\nNo one really knows how big the issue really is either.

The other is your fucking, anything else and you no longer have a job.'  Ironically enough that's exactly why I was late... my gf (now wife) had jumped me as I was getting ready to head out for work.  When I explained that, he gave me a big grin,a slap on the shoulder and said 'fair enough, but tomorrow get up 15 minutes earlier so you can still make it on time.'\n\nBut the point being, being on time every time is a lesson I learned at 16.   Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unemployed.  I don't understand how I could know this at 16, and yet grown ass men in their 30s and 40s still haven't figured it out.",

My background is in truckload/expedited freight due to better margins. Drayage has always seemed to offer $50-100 margins per load, based on customer requirements, so I've typically passed on those opportunities. I'm considering participating in this significant RFP, which involves tens of thousands of moves annually on certain routes and thousands on others. I'm also wondering if the margins make it worthwhile. I'd work with dedicated drayage carriers, but I'm looking for real-world examples or insights. As an agent who's been out of a large company for 10 years, I‚Äôm unsure if drayage is a viable revenue stream for others.",

I do fine with dray because I own all my equipment outright and I usually price my lanes with an All In + chassis pricing model which a lot of customers like. Dray is still a volume game at the end of the day. My brokers who I work with generally still make $100-$250 a container and I still make out ahead too. \n\n \nI still include assessorials for out of pocket things (storage, weekend deliveries, prepulls more than a day before delivery, reefer/genset, hazmat, overweight etc) but the biggest thing with any Drayage work is making sure the carrier you‚Äôre working with can stick to deadlines.  \n\nI probably don‚Äôt need to mention this but 9/10 the shipper/receiver needs that container off the ship and into their warehouse ASAP and is likely the bottle neck for a lot more downward operations. At my own cost I staff an extra truck fueled and insured and a part time driver as well for emergencies/breakdowns but my clients love that shit because of how quickly a late container can affect operations. \n\nShameless Plug, hit me up if you‚Äôre trying to move stuff out of NJ/NY",

    "content": "Hello everyone. My company is just over two years old and has good credit and cash flow without issues until now. Our bond company unexpectedly dropped us after we renewed in July, citing two claims from carriers who alleged non-payment. We proved we paid, and the claims were closed, but that seems irrelevant. Many companies are unwilling to take us on due to this situation, which is frustrating since anyone can file a claim. Even with our strong financials (on track for over $7 million with a solid P&L), it hasn't helped. We're waiting on two more companies but may need to switch to a BMC-85, which we can do. This situation feels absurd, and while I recognize there's a lot of fraud, I suspect many bond companies will soon be dropping numerous clients.",

You see \"demand\" for them because when you need one, you ***need*** one. But you don't need one often enough, otherwise it would be a dedicated customer/carrier. \n\nFor example, we have a Landoll that we use occasionally for a few customers. It just sits in storage the majority of the time because it's not convenient to use for regular open deck loads. When our customers do need it, we charge \\~50% over our normal rate for it. \n\nSo once you have a customer base, then look into buying specialty trailers to fill the niche needs as needed.",

Honestly if you don't know this and nobody in your office knows this it might be a good idea to skip this one because if the rigging company screws this up it's going to be bad. You could get pretty badly fucked up on something like this. Seriously. Not just lose the customer bad, brokerage gets sued bad. They're asking you to arrange something they should be arranging for a reason and that reason is they want to stick you with the risk. Adverse selection loads in my experience are only ever a good idea when you're great at whatever the thing you're doing is. The customer definitely needs to know less than you  and think it's riskier than it is.",

Throughout his authority, he has undergone numerous DOT inspections, but none in the last two years. Today, I faced rejection from over a dozen brokers due to a \"lack of inspections.\" A few months back, the DOT directed weigh stations to stop allowing voluntary inspections, which was the only way for reputable carriers to receive them. The only other way to get inspected is by behaving unsafely in front of an officer. Random inspections at stations are based on observing issues on camera to flag trucks entering the scale. Compliance teams should rethink the need for inspections; soon, only unsafe carriers will meet this requirement, and is that who you want handling your freight? Safe carriers won't have inspections, causing your brokerage to miss out on partnering with reliable ones.",

They seem unaware of the Safer system or FMCSA and aren't following updates in Safer. Another carrier is going through a divorce, and the co-owner refuses to share logins or handle paperwork, keeping both phones and emails and wanting to disengage completely. I‚Äôm feeling very stressed and need suggestions on what to do. I'm concerned that this highway company, which lacks understanding of our industry, might misuse or sell our sensitive information.

This is nothing but paranoid rage bait from people who don't understand the product, what it can and can't access, and what control the carrier has over what information is shared. Highway only pulls information from the FMCSA, what a carrier chooses to provide them, and what they get from a carrier's ins agent. Even the ELD integration is 100% optional for the carrier. Now, a broker may require those things, but that's not Highways choice. \n\nHighway has 0 control over what qualifies a carrier to be used by a particular broker. Those requirements are defined by the broker. If a broker is asking for invasive information, that's on the broker. If you choose to provide that information, that's on you. You want shit like this to stop? Take fraud as seriously as the rest of industry and stop getting your MCs stolen or hijacked, and stop selling them to thieves. Pay attention to your own security practices, and encourage others in the field to take it seriously as well. \n\nAlso OP, if you are having issues it's 90% likely because you are a 3rd party dispatcher working loads for 4 different MCs. Being listed as a contact for the carrier in any other way than as a verified 3rd party dispatcher will get your ass flagged. Figure out what you need to do individually to get verified with Highway and have your carriers list you as a 3rd party dispatcher. It's still up to the broker if you get used at the end of the day, but taking the steps to register legitimately at least tells me you're less likely to be a crook. Contact changes and an unverified 3rd party dispatcher would be an immediate no go for me as well.",

He informed me he loaded around 2 PM, and tracking showed him leaving the shipper, so I updated my customer. The next day, however, I noticed he was still at the shipper, which was unusual. When I called, he revealed he had been rejected the night before due to having other freight on his truck. He had a friend remove that freight so he could return this morning, hoping I wouldn‚Äôt notice. Please, carriers, improve your honesty. Don‚Äôt lie in ways that are easily discoverable or that mislead me with my customer. Just say your truck broke down or you had an issue, but don‚Äôt claim you‚Äôve been loaded when you haven't. That poor excuse turned a missed pickup into a situation where I misrepresented facts to my customer, making everyone look incompetent.",

    "content": "Using return management software offers several benefits. It‚Äôs a one-time investment that effectively supports business growth while decreasing manual tasks, enhancing daily productivity. Here are five key reasons to implement return management software:\n\n**Reason 1: Speed**  \nThis software automates workflows, generates documents, labels, and invoices, and maintains user profiles for quick data allocation on repeated returns. These features significantly accelerate return management and lower the time spent on individual return orders.\n\n**Reason 2: Visibility**  \nReturn management software enhances business visibility and integrity through web-based portals, carrier integration, and bar-coded identifiers. This increased visibility allows for more accurate and efficient shipment handling, reducing costs and improving product recovery.\n\n**Reason 3: Control**  \nIt provides greater control over regulatory compliance, reconciliation, final disposition, and quality assurance. This control bolsters business integrity and enhances customer experience.\n\n**Reason 4: Cost Reduction**  \nThe software helps manage and significantly reduce costs associated with return orders via scheduled pickups, savings on multiple pickups, and improved product recovery. It also minimizes unreasonable returns through effective checks.\n\n**Reason 5: Accuracy**  \nReturn management software ensures accurate returns management with real-time shipment tracking, precise stock management, and better handling of returned and canceled products. This accuracy enhances customer experience by allowing precise responses to availability inquiries.\n\nUnicommerce Return Management software is a leading cloud-based solution that offers comprehensive control over return and cancellation orders. With advanced features and technology, it enables seamless processing and management. Having collaborated with major eCommerce platforms like Jabong, Myntra, and Snapdeal, Unicommerce continuously upgrades its software and has established itself as a formidable market competitor.",

Recently, I developed a health condition that affects my ability to handle the physical demands of entry-level jobs, and I'm concerned about future physical stress. I want to continue pursuing my career in supply chain management. Someone mentioned that experience matters more than a degree, so I'm seeking advice on roles in this field that are less physically demanding and suitable for a newcomer. I'm not strong in math but am willing to learn or take a course if necessary. Additionally, I will have a certified intermediate proficiency in Japanese by graduation. I posted this to avoid feeling lost after graduation and to focus on a goal that will lead me to a position in this field. Thank you for your insights!",

We use rented cargo vans and I need guidance on properly maintaining DVIR logs since we frequently switch vehicles. I also want to confirm my understanding of the driver qualification packet and drug and alcohol clearinghouse requirements for non-CMVs (cargo vans). Is it correct that non-CDL drivers are not required to enter the FMCSA drug and alcohol clearinghouse? What documentation should be included in my driver qualification packets for non-CDL drivers? I've researched extensively on the FMCSA website and called them multiple times, but I still can't find clear answers as most resources focus on CDL operations over 10,000 lbs GVWR.

However, I haven't heard back from the recruiter. How long does it typically take to receive an official offer after reference checks? This role is a 2-year term, and as an international student graduating this December, I need a full-time permanent job to qualify for Canadian PR. This position fits well with my 5 years of procurement experience from India, making it a great career move, but I'm worried about the term nature. Does anyone have tips on leveraging such a role for PR and career advancement in Canada? Are there usually internal opportunities within government jobs for transitioning to permanent positions?",

    "content": "# Planning an international move can be thrilling, but it's easy to overlook the hidden costs that can significantly increase the total expenses. This article examines these unexpected expenses, explains their causes, and offers budgeting tips to help you avoid financial surprises and make your move more affordable.\n\n## 1. Customs and Import Duties: Beyond Paperwork\nWhen moving internationally, you must navigate customs regulations, including potential duties and taxes on your belongings. Each country has different laws, and the value of your items may incur additional fees. \n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Research the specific import duties for your destination.  \n- Consult experienced international movers for estimates based on your items.  \n- Prepare for potential delays during customs clearance.\n\n## 2. Packing and Crating: More Than Just Boxes\nPacking is often a hidden cost that requires specialized materials for fragile or high-value items, contrary to the assumption that standard boxes will suffice. \n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Obtain a detailed packing estimate from your mover.  \n- Consider packing some items yourself to save costs, but recognize that fragile items may still need professional handling.  \n- Reuse packing materials from previous moves if possible.\n\n## 3. Shipping Delays: The Cost of Waiting\nShipping delays can significantly impact your moving budget and timeline, with common delays occurring at ports and customs.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Budget for a longer timeline to accommodate potential delays.  \n- Inquire about storage costs if your items need to be held temporarily.\n\n## 4. Moving Insurance: Protecting Your Valuables\nWhile moving insurance is necessary, many underestimate its cost, especially for valuable items like electronics or heirlooms.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Check if your homeowner‚Äôs insurance covers items in transit.  \n- Get a custom insurance quote based on your total shipment value to avoid surprises.\n\n## 5. Hidden Fees from Shipping Lines\nShipping large items often incurs additional fees not included in initial quotes, such as handling or terminal fees.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Request a full breakdown of your quote to uncover any hidden fees.  \n- Ask about potential discounts for flexible shipping schedules or multiple items.\n\n## 6. Currency Fluctuations: The Impact on Costs\nCurrency fluctuations can affect moving costs, particularly if your move involves multiple currencies. A drop in your home currency can lead to higher expenses.\n\n**How to Plan:**  \n- Lock in currency exchange rates when possible.  \n- Monitor rates leading up to your",

    "content": "The current model for chartering ships to transport goods by sea has developed over several centuries and involves a broker as an intermediary between the shipowner and charterer. This broker negotiates freight contract terms, addressing various transportation details such as loading norms, berth time for cargo operations, cargo release, port services, and transportation costs. Their expertise enables effective communication with both parties, typically charging a 2% commission from each, which increases the contract value by 4-5% and negatively impacts overall transportation economics. Frank Freight offers a solution that allows stakeholders to operate independently, make quicker decisions, and select available vessels or cargo. We believe that removing brokers from this open platform will reduce negotiation time, lower transportation costs, and enhance profitability for both charterers and shipowners.",

    "content": "Chaos in Chittagong üö¢ Bangladesh, a major player in global apparel exports, faced unprecedented turmoil due to political unrest and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, leading to historic congestion at Chittagong Port, crucial for trade. Delays and rising costs prompted international brands like H&M and Zara to reconsider their sourcing strategies. Bangladesh's status as a leading garment exporter was at risk. Can it navigate this crisis and maintain its role in the global supply chain? Discover how the unrest is influencing the global apparel market and Bangladesh‚Äôs prospects. Clash of the Titans üì¶ Business rivalries often resemble epic dramas filled with ambition and high-stakes conflicts. Think of the iconic competition between Apple and Microsoft that shaped the digital age, or the legendary showdown between Ferrari and Ford in automotive history. Now, in e-commerce, Amazon and Walmart are fiercely competing for supremacy. Who will emerge victorious in this online battle? Here‚Äôs our analysis of Amazon vs. Walmart. Homemade Chips üì± The smallest elements can have the greatest impact, and semiconductor chips are prime examples. These tiny components drive technological advancements and economic growth. However, with production dominated by Taiwan, South Korea, and China, the U.S. faces vulnerabilities. The CHIPs Act represents America‚Äôs effort to regain its position and diversify the global semiconductor supply chain. We‚Äôll examine the CHIPs Act‚Äôs journey, its effects over the past two years, and its implications for the U.S. and global semiconductor sectors. Find the complete story here. Mississippi Burning üî• Climate change is disrupting global supply chains, with severe droughts and extreme weather causing major issues. In the U.S., the Mississippi River, a critical trade route, has experienced significant drought, resulting in shipping delays and increased costs. The Panama Canal has also been affected by low water levels, leading to congestion and impacting global trade. These events highlight the vulnerability of supply chains. We investigate the causes, impacts, and implications of these disruptions, as well as the economic effects of climate-related events and how industries are adapting.

I'm curious if setting up sea-steading operations on anchored tankers could enable someone to tap into this large market with minimal taxes, allowing for legal, neutral operations similar to Switzerland, despite my lack of military experience. I understand I'd need to return to school, but I'm willing to do so. My goal is to monopolize the PMC market without owning the companies, akin to how Amazon operates with various sellers on its platform. I recognize the risk of attacks on such a ship, so I plan to establish a private navy, ideally offering \"naval security\" to combat piracy and patrol key maritime routes like the Panama Canal and Suez Canal. I'm seeking guidance beyond typical online articles and popular YouTube channels, perhaps through less conventional community resources.",

The benefits of online shopping, like price differences, product variety, promotions, multiple payment and delivery options, and easy returns, make it a preferred choice for many. However, this surge in demand poses challenges for warehouse owners and managers. To address these issues, many warehouses are adopting advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and productivity. Here are the Top 5 smart technologies currently used in warehouses: \n1. Automated Picking and Sorting tools for efficient storage and increased productivity. \n2. Automated Guided vehicles and conveyor belts for moving stock within the warehouse. \n3. IoT implementation with sensors and data integration to improve accuracy and minimize manual intervention in stock maintenance. \n4. Automated drones with scanners for tracking and counting products, simplifying annual inventory counts.",

I'm currently on a semester break from school to study Information Systems and have gained interest in SCM and logistics while working for a major grocery retailer. I'm considering returning to school to complete my degree online while working. My school offers an online SCM management degree but not for Information Systems. Should I switch to SCM and finish my degree online, or stay with Information Systems and attend in-person classes? I understand there are overlaps, and IS offers more technical skills, but it would be challenging to manage with a full-time job. Any advice or insights would be appreciated.",

    "content": "Understanding the distinction between cost to supply and cost to serve is essential for enhancing profitability in logistics and supply chain management. Both terms relate to the expenses of delivering products to customers, yet they offer different insights. \n\nCost to supply refers to the production and distribution expenses involved in moving a product from the manufacturer to a warehouse or store, including raw materials, manufacturing, and logistics like transportation and warehousing. In contrast, cost to serve (CTS) provides a customer-focused perspective on costs, encompassing supply chain costs plus additional expenses such as customized packaging, promotional costs, returns processing, and specific service level agreements (SLAs). Essentially, it represents the total cost of meeting customer needs.\n\nUnderstanding cost to serve can reveal that certain customers or products may be less profitable than they seem when only considering cost to supply. This is due to cost to serve factoring in specific customer demands that can raise costs, such as last-mile delivery to remote areas or 24/7 customer service.\n\nAnalyzing cost to supply helps businesses grasp the fundamental costs of product production and distribution, while cost to serve analysis assesses the true profitability of each customer or segment. This understanding facilitates data-driven decisions on customer prioritization and pricing strategies.\n\nRecognizing the differences between these metrics can prevent the misconception that a product or customer is profitable solely based on cost to supply. In reality, cost to serve can uncover hidden costs from complex service requirements that may diminish margins. Balancing both metrics ensures companies focus on high-value customers and avoid excessive costs for low-value ones.\n\nWith appropriate tools, businesses can efficiently monitor both cost to supply and cost to serve. Solutions like WMS and TMS enable process automation, system integration, and real-time data access for smarter decision-making. Whether handling complex logistics or enhancing customer service, these tools provide the insights and control needed to minimize unnecessary costs and boost profitability.

    "content": "Industries are experiencing an increase in product returns, transforming what was once a minor issue into a significant challenge that requires its own management system and a dedicated team to handle the large volume of returns daily. Poorly managed returns can severely impact your business, making effective return management essential, particularly in e-commerce. Two common mistakes businesses make in managing returns include: \n\n1. Treating Returns Management as Separate: Many neglect to integrate returns into their business strategy, missing out on valuable insights regarding service issues, customer preferences, and product defects.\n   \n2. Failing to Use Return Management Software: Research indicates that e-commerce businesses face return rates of 15% to 30% of total sales. Managing returns manually can waste time, money, and labor. Return management software automates 90% of the return process, significantly improving customer experience.",

    "content": "I'm addressing an inventory issue for my client and need assistance as I'm new to supply chain management. Company X has 100 stores and one distribution center (DC). We need to determine if another DC is necessary or if we can manage with the existing one. \n\nIn Case 1, if we forecast demand for each store, we can sum these demands to calculate the inventory needed for the DC. If we open another DC, we can distribute this demand based on our Store-DC mapping. Is this correct, or are there potential complications? \n\nIn Case 2, we analyze the historical data at the DC level to forecast demand. If a second DC is opened, we would follow the same process. How do the outcomes differ in both scenarios, what complications might arise, and which method is preferable? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, and if you could share some resources for further reading, that would be helpful. Please don't flag this post as too basic for the subreddit.",

So, I began seeking direct shippers, vendors, and freight forwarders to advance my career. I recently secured a position as a logistics analyst at a large company that manages the supply chain for a fast food chain. A few days into the role, I feel overwhelmed. The interview process was straightforward, and I was honest about my resume and lack of extensive analytical experience, anticipating a learning curve.

About five years ago, I lost satisfaction in my work despite good earnings, and I envied my wife‚Äôs corporate job stories. After a year of contemplation, I decided to find a new job, transferring my company shares to my two brothers and other staff, and delegated my responsibilities. After three months of job hunting, I was offered the Director of Operations position at a well-known MNC 4PL company (Company B), which significantly increased my salary. I quickly accepted and started a couple of months later. In this new role, I enjoyed luxuries like a high-performing team and minimal tasks, often working from home without issues. Over time, I felt restless again, so I contacted headhunters to explore new opportunities.\n\nI quickly landed an interview with an MNC electronics manufacturer (Company C) for the Head of Supply Chain position, which came with a 25% pay increase but required regular office hours. I devised a plan to accept the offer without resigning from Company B. For two months, I managed both roles, reporting to Company B daily while also working at Company C. My responsibilities at Company C were manageable, focusing on order processes and vendor management, which I streamlined. I leave Company C at 5 PM, return to Company B to interact with staff, and then go to Company A to handle minor tasks.\n\nNow, I juggle three incomes but am concerned about being discovered. Company B is pushing me for a Regional Senior VP role that would require relocation, which I might resign over if I can‚Äôt avoid it.

    "content": "Imagine entering a well-organized warehouse where operations run seamlessly‚Äîpackages are sorted, orders are fulfilled promptly, and every team member is well-equipped with the necessary tools. Now, envision attempting to maintain that level of efficiency by merely observing security camera footage all day. Which scenario appears more effective? Businesses have various options for enhancing operations, with Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Computer Vision being two prominent choices. Here‚Äôs why investing in a WMS may be the wiser decision for your company.\n\n### Managing Costs\nCost is a critical factor when adopting new technologies. WMS generally requires an investment between $100,000 and $500,000, with straightforward maintenance and quick implementation‚Äîoften within a few months. In contrast, Computer Vision demands substantial initial spending on cameras and specialized software, with ongoing maintenance that can become costly. Implementation can take up to two years due to extensive data collection and testing. WMS typically provides a return on investment within 12-18 months, while Computer Vision may take years to break even.\n\n### Enhancing Efficiency\nWMS can significantly boost warehouse operations by automating tasks and improving inventory management and order processing. While Computer Vision is useful for specific functions like quality control, it lacks the comprehensive benefits of a WMS and is often viewed as an auxiliary tool rather than a standalone solution.\n\n### Scaling with Your Business\nAs your business expands, your systems must adapt. WMS is designed to accommodate increased volume and complexity, allowing for smooth scaling. In contrast, scaling Computer Vision often involves additional hardware purchases and complex adjustments, driving up costs and implementation time. This inflexibility can hinder growth.\n\n### Utilizing Your Data\nData-driven decision-making is crucial in modern warehouses. WMS offers advanced analytics and integrates seamlessly with other systems, whereas Computer Vision mainly produces visual data that needs further processing for actionable insights. \n\n### The Superior Investment\nWhen evaluating WMS against Computer Vision, WMS emerges as the preferred option for most businesses due to its cost-effectiveness, rapid implementation, scalability, and overall operational impact. While Computer Vision has its niche applications, it lacks the comprehensive management capabilities of a WMS. Although it can provide valuable insights alongside other tools, relying solely on video footage is inadequate without proper event tracking. A fully integrated WMS effectively manages this data.\n\nFor a simpler alternative, consider a solution like Cleverence that enables quick registration of stock movements with mobile devices and barcodes, ensuring accurate tracking of operations without the complexities and costs associated with a full",

Recently, I interviewed for two similar positions: one as a Business Administrator with a successful custom chemical group and another as a Purchasing Assistant with a renowned food services company specializing in rice. After a successful phone interview for the first role, I declined an in-person interview due to accepting an offer from the second company, which is closer to home.\n\nIn the Purchasing Assistant interview, I was asked about my salary expectations and mentioned $20 an hour, though I should have asked for $25, which is my current freelance rate.

    "content": "Warehouse efficiency relies heavily on effective receiving processes, with the choice between one-stage and two-stage receiving impacting operational efficiency and automation strategies, thereby influencing supply chain responsiveness and accuracy. The decision depends on inventory characteristics and warehouse needs. One-stage receiving is best for straightforward, uniform product flows, while two-stage receiving is suited for diverse, complex inventories. Automation systems play a key role in linking physical operations with digital processes, automating tasks like scanning goods and managing quality control, which helps prevent errors and streamline operations. \n\nIn one-stage receiving, goods are sent directly to their storage location upon arrival, which is efficient for uniform products or small volumes. Warehouse staff use digital systems to quickly verify SKUs and determine storage spots, enhancing speed and space utilization. For small shipments, a location-first scanning approach is recommended, while larger ones may favor a product-first method, both aiming for efficient handling without intermediate steps.\n\nConversely, two-stage receiving involves unloading goods to a staging area for quality checks and sorting before placing them in storage. This method suits shipments with varied SKUs and supports meticulous inventory management. Cleverence can adapt to multiple receiving stages, ensuring effective handling of both small and large shipments by prioritizing either product or location based on the inventory specifics.\n\nThe decision between one-stage and two-stage receiving affects inventory accuracy and labor costs. One-stage receiving minimizes handling and potential errors, relying heavily on initial checks and automation tools for accuracy. In contrast, two-stage receiving offers more verification points to catch discrepancies early, though it can be more labor-intensive. \n\nOne-stage receiving generally incurs lower labor costs due to fewer handling steps, making it efficient for operations with limited staff. However, it demands high accuracy from the start. Two-stage receiving, while possibly more costly in labor, allows for specialization, reducing errors and improving throughput. Ultimately, the choice should consider the balance between labor savings and the risk of inaccuracies, with advanced automation systems enhancing both methods by improving data accuracy and labor efficiency.",

With limited experience at one company and minimal formal training, I am unsure about competing with candidates who have degrees or diverse backgrounds. My goal is not to earn a high salary but to find a comfortable position.",

    "content": "Hello, everyone. I'm seeking career advice from professionals on how to proceed. I have nearly 2 years of experience in supply chain, starting as a logistics coordinator at a 4PL company, where I worked with Excel and ERP. I then moved to a manufacturing company as an operations analyst in the Finance department, focusing on finance operations support. Over the past year, I‚Äôve developed skills in cost analysis for work orders and labor reports, inventory analysis, and collaborating with Production on weekly special parts schedules. My team also handles material planning for SKUs, updates part costs in ERP based on burden and labor, and occasionally provides quotes to sales when my supervisor is absent. I've narrowed my options to two paths: advancing in supply chain (which seems limited in salary growth) or transitioning to finance or accounting. I'm unsure what direction to take, but my main motivation is adequate compensation, so I want to shape my career accordingly. Additionally, I have an engineering background and a PG diploma in Business Analytics, so I'm uncertain how pursuing a master's degree would fit in.",

My responsibilities include ordering office supplies and raw materials as requested by departments and managing inventory reorders based on demand forecasts. I prefer this job over my previous one, where my manager was unpredictable and controlling. In my last position, I handled shipping, inventory management, and vendor issues, often working through breaks, and I was misled about a promised raise. Now, I enjoy collaborating with knowledgeable buyers and supporting different departments. However, I've been offered an interview for an inventory specialist position at an aerospace company that pays $3-7 more per hour and has a short 10-minute commute. Although I'm attracted to this opportunity, I worry about potentially leaving my enjoyable job for a more stressful one and concerns about job security in the aerospace sector. I'm conflicted between pursuing a purchasing role (desk job) or inventory control (more mobile). Any advice would be helpful! Thanks for reading.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, what processes do you use for managing receiving errors? We primarily utilize EDI with ASN labels and create our own labels for internal purposes. We encounter two main errors: vendor errors and internal errors. Secondary errors include incorrectly tagged UPCs and mixed cases. We allow a 100% overage before the system rejects a shipment, and typically, we issue a new PO for the overage, making it difficult to catch mistakes until later. This results in many PODs from vendors, as the overage often signifies a shortage due to an error. When an error is identified, it is sent to a specific area for investigation (if we adhere to our SOP), but sometimes it is just reshelved. Currently, there is no reporting process for this, leading to inventory accuracy issues, which we then manually adjust upon discovery, creating further inventory complications. Our main software is JDA, along with a custom WMS. I'm curious about how our process compares to others. How do you receive products? How do you manage overages and shortages? What steps do you take to correct your inventory? How do you handle reshelving in your forward pick, if applicable? Do you cross-dock? How many warehouses do you operate? What software do you use? Do you rely on 3PLs for receiving, and is it done in-house or off-site?",

We have a warehouse at our new office where we store inventory for our maintenance and HVAC teams, including appliances for unit upgrades and turns. Currently, we lack an inventory management system; we only have a person using a spreadsheet, which doesn‚Äôt track who takes items or their whereabouts. I want to implement a QR-based system that allows items to be scanned out of the warehouse (indicating who took them and removing them from 'warehouse inventory') and scanned in at the property (adding to the property's 'in-use inventory'). Each maintenance team member should have individual access to link inventory to them. I also want to generate inventory reports to inform our purchasing agent about our needs. I'm unsure if QR is the best option, but it emerged from our brainstorming. I believe something similar exists, but I'm struggling to find solutions that aren't retail-focused or overloaded with unnecessary work order features, as those are managed in our PMS.

    "content": "You may have realized that your operations are suffering from poor organization or data accountability, or you need a better way to manage your inventory. Selecting the right software tailored to your business needs is crucial. Finding the best option can be challenging since software effectiveness is subjective. First, assess your workflow and identify your challenges. Are your daily operations as efficient as you'd like, or do they need a complete overhaul? Consider how much time employees spend tracking inventory, whether in the warehouse or through spreadsheets. Time wasted on these tasks impacts productivity. Evaluate your current inventory management expenses and the losses from inefficiencies. If your existing system costs more than it saves, it's time to reconsider. If you lack a management system and have excess stock or fail to meet demand for popular items, you are incurring losses. Aim for near 100% accuracy in order and fulfillment, which can be hard to achieve without the right tools. Relying on Excel increases the risk of errors, while barcode scanning can enhance accuracy by automating inventory updates. \n\nWhen searching for inventory software, consider industry compatibility, as different sectors have unique needs. E-commerce businesses need integrations with shopping carts, while 3PL companies require client portals. Prioritize cloud-based software for security and ease of access. You may also need hardware like barcode scanners or label printers. Easy data import and export are essential when transitioning to a new system. Look for flexible pricing plans that allow your software to grow with your business. \n\nDon't hesitate to ask for assistance when starting with a new tool; developers appreciate feedback and may provide features you haven't discovered. Integrate all your tools to streamline operations and reduce redundant tasks. \n\nEvaluate the software provider as much as the product itself. Look for flexible contract terms without long commitments or cancellation fees. Seek vendors with genuine industry expertise and proven track records. Post-sale support is vital, so assess the provider‚Äôs ability to assist you after purchase. Ensure support comes from knowledgeable staff, and consider testing their responsiveness.

He noted that the larger cross-dock allows for immediate unloading and reduces reloading time since forklift drivers avoid unnecessary movement. If 350 loads are picked up in a day, reducing load time by 10 minutes saves nearly 60 hours total. C.H. Robinson manages over 1 million shipments annually at the Mexico-U.S. border.",

    "content": "I believe I can improve my DC performance, but I'm currently at a standstill. I work for a 3PL company that only handles the receipt and delivery of parcels, so our inventory turnover should be high due to our location. The DC receives numerous parcels daily that need sorting by destination. However, our outbound performance, based on timely dispatch (parcels received under 30 minutes before dispatch), is low at 80-90%. This is due to issues like missing parcels and slow loading/unloading. \n\nWe use woven bags for parcel storage because they are waterproof and prevent theft, but they create handling challenges since they aren't flat like boxes. We previously tried using boxes but reverted to bags. I'm new here and would like to understand the benefits of using boxes over bags. Using bags leads to damage as operators manually toss them from the truck, creating disorganized piles that can increase loading times. \n\nI‚Äôm considering using mobile carts instead of placing parcels on the ground. I found a container design that could accommodate various parcel shapes, but I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs practical for unloading. While it facilitates quick movement in the warehouse, it doesn‚Äôt solve loading and unloading issues, and we can‚Äôt stack them high, limiting capacity. Additionally, the size of the parcel piles varies significantly based on their destination. \n\nWe have a gravity conveyor, but operators prefer throwing parcels for speed, unless they‚Äôre already grouped in baskets for scanning. However, managing baskets across the warehouse network is complicated. I'm overwhelmed with the issues we need to address and would appreciate your insights. Thank you.",

While only a portion of these entries is available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the share of T86 entries is expected to grow as US regulations tighten.

The commodities are stable, consisting of well-known brands with long product cycles, not from a marketplace. The goal is to launch ASAP, potentially starting next week with the right partner.

We manufacture the product in-house, which consists of around 100 parts, some of which are custom-made and require fabrication.

With around 400 SKUs, most of which have low quantities, my inventory is consistently changing. Other departments have designated personnel for this, but it doesn't align with my area. We receive daily replenishments based on an automated system, and I need to ensure that our physical inventory matches the management system. I created a cycle count schedule to perform a full inventory count roughly every month (every 20 business days). What is a suitable frequency for cycle counts? More frequent counts lead to greater accuracy, but my time is limited due to my other responsibilities. If inventory discrepancies arise, production can be disrupted since automated replenishments won't trigger unless inventory levels drop below a certain percentage of maximum capacity (excluding broken or scrapped items). I'm seeking insights from anyone experienced in managing production inventories. TL;DR: How often should I conduct cycle counts if my company lacks established standards? Monthly? Quarterly?",

For instance, if the sales department confirms a delivery of 50 TVs for tomorrow, the 3PL will deliver them during business hours the next day. One policy of our 3PL is that drivers do not call recipients before deliveries; they arrive and request to unload. I've learned the reasons behind this: deliveries are pre-scheduled, so recipients should be prepared at any time during the day; drivers have multiple stops, and calling may lead to specific timing requests that disrupt their routes; and reducing calls helps cut costs for the 3PL. However, I‚Äôm uncertain if this is standard for all 3PL providers. This approach frustrates me because the sales team often asks for ETAs, and I can only advise them that if a delivery is scheduled for today, recipients should be prepared at any time. The sales team believes this practice is irresponsible and harms customer experience.",

My ideas include: \n\n- **Inventory Tracking**: The software would monitor the quantity and location of all ingredients, providing real-time visibility into inventory levels.\n- **Automated Reordering**: It would automatically create purchase orders when stock falls below a set level, reducing manual ordering and preventing stockouts.\n- **Recipe Management**: Allows input of ingredient amounts according to product formulations, using this data to automate orders based on production plans.\n- **Co-packer Integration**: Connects with co-packer systems to streamline information sharing and automate some communications.\n\nI'm curious about your experiences: What challenges do you face with current inventory management systems?

Currently, we use Google Sheets to manually log when we produce a flavor, when it ships to another store, and when it's used. Since Google Sheets isn't very intuitive, we're seeking a better solution, possibly something akin to warehouse management. \n\nWe want the kitchen to log ice cream production using a QR code that updates the stock in the system as it's stored in the freezer. When stores need to order ice cream, the kitchen will scan the flavors being shipped. Upon delivery, the store will scan the received flavors, and when they sell a flavor, they will scan the QR code again. The QR code will help track production date and the entire process. \n\nCan an inventory management app address this? Any suggestions?

    "content": "I‚Äôve seen some discussions on this topic, but most responses are from nearly a year ago or from less experienced individuals (I have nearly ten years). The remote job market has worsened recently, especially with layoffs (I was affected). For those who secured remote roles, what strategies helped you stand out? I‚Äôve been refining my cover letters, but they haven‚Äôt led to interviews, despite spending hours on them. How long did it take you to land a remote position? I have substantial experience, nearly ten years in inventory management and capacity planning, including S&OP, forecasting, production planning, and informal demand planning. I‚Äôve served as an operations manager and led teams in two roles. I excel in Excel and consistently receive positive feedback on my work. I‚Äôve developed my own forecasting tools, worked on inventory program implementations, and have 3-4 years of SAP experience, although my production planning was primarily with industry-specific MES/APS systems or an older MRP system (QAD). I adapt quickly to new systems; for instance, I had to learn a new inventory management system on short notice to train users. My previous boss even assigned me a computer science intern due to my technical skills, including my SAP experience and complex forecasting spreadsheets. We were working on process automation before the company could no longer afford him. This reads like a resume without the numbers, right? I have strong experience but struggle with visibility. The only gap in my background is specific sourcing/vendor management. I‚Äôve communicated with suppliers, worked on RFQs, and negotiated prices, but I haven‚Äôt held a formal vendor management role. I worry this might hinder me, yet I can‚Äôt be the only one landing jobs without every specific requirement. I previously posted in another group, and someone suggested IBP roles given my broad experience, which interests me, but I still need to stand out among many qualified candidates. I‚Äôm open to in-office work; I did so in my last job and was hybrid before that. However, I relocated to an area with a limited job market and am looking locally. Opportunities that match my skills and previous salary are primarily in healthcare, a field where I lack experience. Most positions pay significantly less than what I earned, despite having an Ivy League degree and an MBA. Living costs are high, so I can‚Äôt return to my previous salary from when I had just a few years of experience.",

I then moved into Master Data, Analytics (mainly creating Excel reports), Supply Chain Analytics (reporting within the supply chain), and worked as a Demand and Inventory Manager (overseeing supply/demand planning and inventory). For the last few years, I've been a Global Pricing Analyst, totaling around 12 years of experience. I'm skilled in Excel (including macros), Power BI, am nearly finished learning Python, and have basic SQL knowledge. I aim to return to the supply chain field and explore advanced topics where I can utilize my analytics skills. I'm considering these options and would appreciate your insights: 1. CPIM: This would deepen my understanding of inventory management, scheduling, and planning, allowing me to enhance my role through analytics, given my background. 2. CSCP: This certification is reportedly more recognized than CPIM, but it includes topics like sourcing and logistics that I'm less interested in. Does it sufficiently cover planning and inventory management? My next role will likely focus on these areas. 3. MITx Supply Chain Management (edX): This program seems comprehensive and affordable, but I've heard it may not be highly regarded by recruiters. 4. Coursera/Other Courses: I have a year of Coursera Plus access, allowing me to take courses like Supply Chain Analytics (Rutgers) and others at no extra cost. I also have Udemy courses on SCM KPIs, inventory management, and planning that I could complete to demonstrate my knowledge in interviews. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the best path for me. Thank you!",

    "content": "Reducing inventory costs is crucial for minimizing financial risk and preventing losses from spoilage. Many view inventory costs merely as the value of stored products, but they encompass much more, including: the value of purchased products, taxes on stored goods, purchasing taxes, labor costs, security expenses, insurance, the value of obsolete items, transportation and handling fees, and storage costs like rent and utilities, especially for temperature-controlled spaces. If you're concerned about rising inventory costs and want to manage them effectively, consider these strategies: avoid suppliers with minimum order quantities, restock only when necessary, optimize stock space, quickly eliminate outdated products even at a loss, adopt Lean Manufacturing, streamline workflows to reduce product wait times, and use Inventory Management Software. Implementing these tips can significantly lower your inventory costs and enhance your business growth.",

    "content": "After a year with inFlow, we're ready to leave. I run a small D2C airsoft brand using a 3PL, and last year we needed an MRP/inventory management solution due to tracking difficulties. With only a three-person team, a costly custom solution wasn't feasible, so I researched 15 MRP/ERP options, prioritizing a modern UI/UX and Shopify integration. We chose inFlow, paying ‚Ç¨350/month, which is steep for us, but we hoped for a quality product. Onboarding was easy, and their label printing software is impressive.\n\nHowever, I overlooked a critical detail: imported sales orders from Shopify were sourced from random locations due to a setup issue. With only two locations‚Äîour 3PL warehouse and our office‚Äîthis led to significant inventory inaccuracies, which we initially misattributed to our own errors. After five months of back-and-forth with customer support, we learned that inFlow's Shopify integration is flawed for app-based locations. They blamed our use of a third-party app, despite it being widely used and compliant with Shopify's Fulfillment API.\n\nThe main issue is that their app lacks the necessary permission scope and requires an update, which they have not prioritized. Even suggesting a simple fix was ignored. Although we requested a discount for our troubles, we were offered a mere 10% reduction and an upsell to an annual plan. A co-founder acknowledged our frustrations but offered no solutions. \n\nAdditionally, there‚Äôs a separate unresolved bug where new product categories are automatically visible to all B2B customers, necessitating manual adjustments for each account. Despite these critical flaws, the rest of the product is solid. However, the lack of support and urgency for fixes has ruined our experience. We must find a new solution, as inFlow has shown no commitment to addressing our issues. This serves as a warning to potential users: they may not address your concerns.",

Proposed tariffs by Trump on Chinese products in January may prompt manufacturers to import more goods now to avoid extra taxes once tariffs are implemented, leading to unexpected volume increases in an already tight holiday market. \n2. Trump has indicated he will influence interest rates, meaning cuts may not solely rely on economic factors but also on his preferences. This could lead to lower interest rates, increasing money circulation and freight demand. \n3. Many illegal drivers and Mexican carriers taking low-paying loads may leave the U.S. trucking system before or when Trump takes office, as ICE is expected to intensify deportation efforts, raising the likelihood of police stops. \n4. Legal immigrants may also avoid trucking due to concerns that certain violations on a CDL could jeopardize their chances of obtaining a green card or citizenship, making the risks of trucking too high compared to a regular 9-5 job, further reducing capacity. \n5. Historically, many operators exit the market during winter due to financial strain, as they are often just one breakdown away from bankruptcy.",

    "content": "### What is Automation in Inventory and Asset Management? \nEfficient inventory and asset management is crucial for businesses. Cleverence enhances these processes through technology like barcodes, auto-ID mobile devices, ERP integration, and business process automation, addressing accuracy and efficiency needs. Barcodes and auto-ID technologies reduce manual data entry errors, ensuring precise inventory levels and asset tracking. Auto-ID mobile devices streamline operations by minimizing reliance on central databases or paperwork. ERP integration is essential for seamless data management. Data capture automation digitizes information using barcode scanners or RFID readers, while business process automation (BPA) encompasses broader operational workflows, integrating various systems for improved efficiency and real-time decision-making.\n\n### Why Customers Choose Cleverence\nCleverence provides a superior solution for automating inventory and asset management, outperforming manual methods, existing ERP modules, and custom development. This chapter highlights its efficiency, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Manual Processes\n\"Manual\" processes involve human execution without automated systems, including tasks like:\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Hand-entering data into spreadsheets or databases, sometimes using barcode scanners.\n- **Manual Physical Counts:** Counting inventory by visual inspection and tallying items.\n- **Paper-Based Tracking:** Using printed documents for inventory management.\n- **Manual Reconciliation:** Comparing physical counts with recorded data.\n- **Visual Inspections:** Checking assets without digital tools.\n\nThe misconception that barcode scanners equate to automation overlooks that true automation encompasses the entire data workflow, minimizing manual intervention. Cleverence utilizes mobile devices and an app that provides real-time ERP data, allowing employees to access stock levels and task lists directly on their devices.\n\n### Cleverence vs. ERP Modules\nERP systems manage various business processes but often lack depth in auto-ID and logistics without custom development. Cleverence effectively addresses these gaps. Many ERP systems offer basic auto-ID support, limited customization, and inadequate logistics features. Customizing ERPs can be costly and time-consuming. Cleverence offers advanced auto-ID capabilities, customizable Android apps, and efficient ERP integration, enhancing system functionalities without extensive custom work.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Custom Development\nCustom development can provide tailored solutions but is resource-intensive, costly, and may lack scalability. Cleverence offers ready-to-deploy solutions that are easily integrated and scalable, avoiding the challenges of custom development. Unlike custom projects, which often exceed budgets and timelines, Cleverence uses a device license model, ensuring predictable costs and rapid implementation.\n\n### How to Sell Cleverence",

Some details are intentionally vague, but feel free to ask for clarification to enhance the quality of responses. I aim to build a solid supply chain career and take on a leadership role.

While I want to advance in supply chain, I feel confined to logistics and lack leadership experience. My current role primarily supports outbound export shipments, along with inbound shipments and inventory management for our FTZ team. My company is undergoing significant changes, leading to high turnover in the supply chain team, including upper management. I had a supportive manager who is no longer with the company. Recently, I reached out to a former contact about an Operations Supervisor position at an LTL trucking company, and the conversation went well; I‚Äôm currently interviewing and expect an offer. It may involve a pay cut, which makes me hesitant, but I can manage financially. Should I take the Supervisor role at the LTL trucking company or try to navigate my current company's transition to move into a broader supply chain role in buying/planning/quality? Additionally, has anyone transitioned from LTL ops supervisor to ops manager and then to a regional/global supply chain manager role? Or is the LTL sector too specialized for such a move?

While many CRMs allow data import via CSV files, my customer and sales order lists update frequently, and I need those changes reflected in the CRM quickly (ideally hourly).

Recommendations for someone with a few years in logistics: Which certification would you suggest for my background? 4. Preparation resources: Were there any specific books, courses, or materials you found particularly useful?

I'm sharing this not to boast, but to illustrate that I handle large accounts where my competitors are major 3PLs. One of my shippers deals in electronics with shipments valued at $250k. My competitors (TQL, CH, Arrive) consistently secure more freight, which is fine, but their extremely low prices seem unusual. My question is whether large 3PLs sometimes risk shipping high-value cargo using trucks with only $100k cargo insurance, while a $250k insured carrier might transport for an Albanian owner-operator with just $100k insurance. If one shipment encounters an accident or theft and my insurance is inadequate, it could jeopardize my business. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue.",

A third-party company will be the direct contact, and I need to send them photos of my truck and ID. If approved and I accept the contract, I must pay a one-time fee equal to my daily rate ($900). The 3PL rep called from their number but won't provide email verification, and I can't reach anyone by phone to confirm his identity.

This could be a significant opportunity for me, but I'm unsure about sending my truck and driver's license photos. The third party says they can get my W9 and insurance from 3PL, which makes me suspect. If it‚Äôs legit and I fail to meet the contract terms, how could it affect my MC? My truck has an engine light on, minor leaks, and a slight odor from patching the leaks, but they want a \"clean truck with no odor.\" The third party warned that failing to honor the contract could \"hurt my MC.\" Thanks for your help.",

    "content": "This is probably my first time using Reddit for advice on a real-life issue (usually it's for gaming). Here‚Äôs my situation: A few months ago, I began working at a coffee roasting factory with 11 production lines, 5 roasters, 6 grinders, 3 daily shifts (plus one on weekends), and nearly 100 operators. I serve as the supply chain administrative assistant, handling daily production reports, planning support, operator clothing, invoicing, and basic inventory tracking. Recently, my boss requested that we start a tool inventory, and after learning the process, I found it outdated and very time-consuming, with no effective tracking. The last inventory was done months ago (the previous assistant was fired), and operators frequently ‚Äúmisplace‚Äù tools. I want to propose a new method to streamline tool inventory management and hold operators somewhat accountable. Here‚Äôs what I know: \n\n1. Each production line has a specific tool kit, with some tools for general use. \n2. Operators can carry a small bag for minor tools; they might fit more tools in there or we could provide better bags. \n3. We currently use a simple spreadsheet for inventory. \n4. I have a list of tools for each line to identify common and specific items. \n5. I lack clearance for surveillance cameras, and there‚Äôs little interest in tracking tool misplacements due to resource constraints. \n6. Missing tools are simply replaced, but my boss and the maintenance team are frustrated with this approach. \n7. Most operators have been with the company for over five years, which may help with solutions.\n\nI‚Äôm considering creating a ‚Äúcommon tool kit‚Äù for every operator and a ‚Äúspecific tool kit‚Äù for each production line, but this won't fully resolve the misplacement issue. How should I approach this? What am I overlooking? I need ideas for a plan to present, as I have approval to test my proposal on one of the largest lines.

Their batteries last only around 10 years and are costly to replace, charging infrastructure is lacking, and sourcing materials is becoming more difficult and expensive. Hydrogen seems more likely to prevail once it's proven safe and practical for consumers. So why are we offering tax incentives and other benefits for EV buyers? This frustrates me, especially since I work in supply chain. Many agree that EVs aren‚Äôt suitable for long-haul trucking due to the heavy batteries, inadequate charging infrastructure, and shorter battery life compared to diesel. Despite this, companies like Tesla continue to thrive‚Äîcould it be due to Elon Musk's influence? I've come to wonder if the promotion of EVs is a strategy to curb Saudi wealth, as more EVs could mean reduced oil purchases from them. Musk has strong ties to the government and plays a key role in national security through his satellite operations. Is this support for EVs part of a broader strategy to limit financial dependency on Saudi Arabia? Today, I noticed they're finally facing financial losses, which sparked these thoughts. What do you think? EVs seem like a short-term government push with a global agenda while we seek better sustainable energy solutions.",

    "content": "DP World has revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) is a key factor in transforming global supply chains. A significant 98% of executives view AI as vital for industry reshaping, signaling a shift towards digitalization and innovation in logistics and supply management. The use of AI technologies is essential, redefining traditional supply chain operations with enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and speed. Companies can utilize predictive analytics for better demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and improved route planning, leading to reduced costs, minimized waste, and increased customer satisfaction through timely deliveries. AI also enhances transparency and resilience in supply chain management, enabling businesses to address disruptions from geopolitical issues, pandemics, or climate change by anticipating challenges and adapting quickly. With real-time data analysis and machine learning, AI helps identify potential bottlenecks, fostering agility in operations. Additionally, AI promotes sustainability by optimizing routes to cut fuel consumption and emissions, aligning with environmental goals and enhancing brand reputation amidst rising regulatory demands. According to DP World, this consensus among executives marks a transformative period in global trade and logistics, with AI integration paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable future. As technology advances, AI's potential to further innovate these networks remains vast, ushering in a new era of growth for businesses worldwide.",

It can be tailored to the product's dimensions and is used for solid bottles and loose bags, though its production competes with food industry corn demand.\n\n- **Mushroom Packaging**: Made from the inedible parts of mushrooms, this affordable option is more sustainable than seaweed and cornstarch packaging.\n\n- **Edible Packaging Material**: Available in various shapes, this packaging is designed to be consumed, eliminating the need for disposal.\n\n- **Biodegradable Air Peanuts**: These environmentally friendly fillers protect sensitive products from damage and serve as a sustainable alternative to Styrofoam.",

    "content": "Inventory is essential for retail businesses, and effective management is crucial. Poor inventory management is a leading cause of small business failures, often due to a series of errors resulting in poor decisions. In competitive markets with tight margins, small businesses cannot afford such mistakes. Overestimating demand leads to excess inventory, incurring storage costs and risking spoilage or obsolescence, while underestimating frustrates customers who may seek alternatives. Accurate demand forecasting is challenging, but without current and precise data, success is unlikely. Many small business owners still rely on pen-and-paper or spreadsheets for inventory tracking, which is prone to data-entry errors causing costly shipping mistakes and flawed forecasting. \n\nPoint-of-sale software offers accuracy, but small businesses hesitate to invest in technology like barcode scanners or RFID tags. If inventory data is inaccurate, resource planning becomes ineffective. Although inventory software can be costly, competitive software vendors provide appealing solutions for small businesses. Cloud-based inventory software enables real-time stock visibility across multiple locations, with dashboards for easy information visualization accessible from PCs or mobile devices. It can integrate with ERP systems for improved forecasting and support online sales, allowing customers to check product availability.\n\nAs retailers grow, cloud-based software can adapt seamlessly to new shippers or scanning systems. While these systems are user-friendly post-setup, deciding on features and integration can be complex. Modern omnichannel strategies require diverse technologies for mobility, social media, logistics, and analytics, often beyond the capacity of typical retail IT teams, leading to increased outsourcing. Effective inventory management is vital for retail success. Retailers are investing in cloud-based software and expert assistance to improve systems, using a combination of barcode and RFID technologies to enhance forecasts and reduce costs.",

    "content": "I have a question about managing inventory for a central warehouse servicing multiple retail stores based on their total sales. Specifically, how should I determine the reorder point (ROP) for the warehouse? Should the ROP consider only the warehouse's inventory levels, or should it also include the combined inventory of all the retail stores? Would this differ if the warehouse functions as a cross-docking facility versus a break-bulk facility? I appreciate any insights on this! Thank you! Edit: Thanks for the responses. I might not have been clear in my initial post, so let me provide an example: In our system, a planner sets minimum and maximum inventory levels for both the warehouse and individual stores, which are tracked in our ERP system. Store levels are based on their demand, while the warehouse levels reflect total store demand. Orders are placed when the warehouse reaches a ROP calculated as follows: 1. Daily Demand: Total expected usage from forecasts. 2. Anticipated Lead Time: Supplier to warehouse plus warehouse to stores. 3. Safety Stock: (Z √ó œÉLT √ó DD avg) or another formula as needed. When the net available quantity (on-hand inventory ‚Äì committed inventory + current replenishment) hits the ROP, an order should be placed. My question is: Should the warehouse order based on its own net available quantity or the combined net available quantity of both the warehouse and stores? For instance: Warehouse ROP: 20; Warehouse net available quantity: 20; Warehouse + stores net available quantity: 120. Should an order be placed because the warehouse's net available quantity reached the ROP, or should no order be placed since the combined quantity is well above the ROP?",

    "content": "Hello everyone! At Descartes, we've been examining trends in home delivery and have completed our 2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study. Given the developments in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to investigate how consumer preferences for sustainability impact last-mile delivery. 57% of consumers are interested in sustainable delivery options, and an impressive 99% are willing to take further steps to lower their carbon footprint. However, 89% mentioned that economic factors, such as inflation, influence their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Notably, 37% now consider convenience and sustainability equally important when selecting delivery methods. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which bundle multiple orders into fewer trips to reduce emissions and costs, with 56% of respondents open to this approach. This could be a crucial innovation for last-mile providers to support environmental efforts while effectively managing costs. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector adapting to achieve sustainability goals amid cost challenges? Are there new technologies or processes helping you find this balance?

Our business, which imports \"flat pack\" items and offers them either assembled or unassembled, has grown rapidly beyond what Excel can manage. We have about 400 SKUs per color and occasionally purchase products from other vendors, assemble them, and sell them. Complicating matters, shipping costs can vary significantly, from $8,000 to $20,000, and I need to ensure proper cost allocation for each product. While I've consulted with several accountants and a consulting group, they all recommend QuickBooks, but I‚Äôm unsure if it meets our needs.

Upon receiving items, I contact them for a spreadsheet with barcode numbers, style numbers, colors, sizes, titles, descriptions, and available images. I can‚Äôt be the only retailer making such requests, especially with many people listing products online or using inventory systems that require this information. It's common to see identical descriptions and titles across different websites, indicating wholesalers provide the same details to retailers. Yet, when I reach out, representatives often seem surprised by my request, needing multiple transfers to possibly locate a ‚Äúdownload as .xlsx or .csv‚Äù option for my order. Why is this process so cumbersome? Surely larger retailers like Walmart don‚Äôt manually copy product details for every new item. While I'm aware of EDI systems that automate inventory for big companies, I don‚Äôt think I need one to obtain a simple spreadsheet for my small business. Currently, I‚Äôm manually entering about 90% of the required information, typing style numbers without digital invoices, or copying them from invoices one at a time, then scanning barcodes as items arrive.

Effective integration can save resources and reduce human errors. \n\n2. **Third-Party Fulfillment Partner (3PL)**: If your company lacks the capacity to fulfill orders, consider partnering with a 3PL. This option eliminates the need for fulfillment software, warehouse space, shipping interfaces, and additional staff. Ensure you understand your budget and business needs before selecting a suitable 3PL.\n\n3. **Dropshipping**: If you don‚Äôt stock or manufacture products, consider dropshipping. This method relies on manufacturers to produce, store, and ship products directly to customers.\n\n4. **Utilize Integration Solutions**: To fulfill orders quickly, maintain visibility across logistics, sales, and inventory. Real-time access to data is essential, and integrating platforms like your website, inventory system, shopping cart, warehouse management, CRM, and accounting software is crucial for meeting customer expectations.\n\n5. **Understand Your Cost Per Order**: Longer fulfillment times typically lead to higher costs due to disconnected systems, resulting in repeated data entry and comparisons across various applications.\n\n6. **Minimize the Impact of Order Returns**: Facilitating easy returns is vital for customer satisfaction in a competitive market. While it enhances engagement, high return rates can increase operational costs without generating revenue.",

    "content": "In 2020, modern businesses have recognized the necessity of inventory management software for running an efficient phone repair shop. In a competitive market, repair store owners cannot afford to waste money. Let's explore common inventory management challenges and how POS software can help address them. \n\nChallenge 1: Unknown Inventory \nUnderstanding essential versus non-essential items and their ordering timelines is crucial. Essential items are those that are popular or sold year-round and require constant restocking. Identifying core items is just the start; you must also know what‚Äôs in stock, what needs ordering, and what requires restocking. Managing inventory can be overwhelming but is essential for profitability, and a quality POS system can assist greatly.\n\nChallenge 2: Manual Inventory Tracking \nMany businesses begin with manual inventory tracking, like spreadsheets. However, this method becomes problematic for larger businesses with multiple outlets, leading to unreliable real-time information and inaccurate counts. Such inaccuracies can result in excess or insufficient inventory, causing customer dissatisfaction. Automating through POS software is the optimal solution, providing real-time tracking, low-stock alerts, inventory counts, reorder notifications, and quick purchase orders.\n\nChallenge 3: Decentralized Inventory Records \nCentralizing inventory allows management from one location for all repair stores, enhancing control over operations like reordering and receiving. This efficiency simplifies managing multi-channel orders and inventory levels, improving customer experience through accurate product information and stock availability.\n\nChallenge 4: Lack of Transparency \nIBM reports that 79% of store owners find lack of transparency significantly impacts profits. Today‚Äôs businesses prioritize transparency in operations, ensuring employees and customers are informed about item statuses. Even with solid inventory strategies, issues may arise, so keeping customers updated on order delays can adjust their expectations and maintain confidence. Clear communication is vital, including notifying customers when items are back in stock.\n\nThe Solution: Cloud-Based Inventory Management & Repair Store Software \nAn effective inventory management system is now a reality. If you haven't selected a POS software for your repair store, consider investing in automated inventory control to eliminate manual tasks and enhance efficiency. A smart inventory management solution provides real-time data access, enabling valuable insights for better forecasting and streamlining processes‚Äîmaking inventory management simpler through automation.",

I've worked on both the 3PL/freight brokerage side and the customer side, and it's been quite a journey. As an account coordinator at a 3PL, the workload is intense, with overwhelming emails and last-minute issues. Larger 3PLs provide some work-life balance by having specific teams manage after-hours problems, while smaller brokerages expect near-constant availability. I earned about $64K, but the stress and off-hours calls were draining. On the customer side, being a logistics specialist is less intense. In smaller companies, the workload was manageable, and I rarely worked late or outside regular hours, but the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. Although the role is more relaxed, it falls short of my $100K salary goal without moving into rare managerial roles. I also explored customs clearance, which involves constant updates and issues but offers little financial improvement. Overall, logistics is a challenging, undervalued field, and the pay reflects that. It‚Äôs tough to find well-paying roles without excessive hours.

The pickup occurred last Wednesday via a transport company I've used frequently, with delivery on Thursday and a POD received by Monday morning. However, my customer emailed at noon saying not all goods were received. After some discussion, the trucking company informed me that the warehouse only loaded the 7 skids for AWB B onto the truck, claiming that the driver presented both AWBs. The trucking company blames the warehouse for not loading the correct pallets, while the warehouse is unresponsive. Since I live across the country, I can't verify the loading. Whose responsibility is this: the trucking company, the warehouse, or neither? Additionally, I might be misusing terms; the trucking company operates as a logistics provider that contracts smaller carriers. Is that considered a brokerage, logistics, or 3PL?",

Since the company is just starting out, there are no established processes or systems, and I want to set up a strong foundation for future growth. I lack inventory experience, so this is my first time handling such responsibilities. \n\nThe business needs to assemble about 5-10 large products each month, using approximately 40 pieces of raw materials for each finished product. While this volume is manageable, it is expected to grow quickly. Therefore, I need a system to track inventory, including beginning inventory, purchases, work in progress, finished goods, and ending inventory. I am considering a barcoding system with SKUs to streamline this process. With around 40-50 types of raw materials, I can assign barcodes to each location. At the end of each day or week, an employee can scan the barcodes and log the quantities, allowing for easy conversion to a spreadsheet or system. I‚Äôm looking for feedback on this idea, as I believe it could simplify inventory management and reduce manual counting.\n\nWhile I am proficient in Excel and can start tracking inventory there, I believe that for long-term success and growth, it would be beneficial to implement dedicated inventory software.

Recurring Clients: Must save client info for automatic invoice inclusion. \n5. Invoice Generation: System should produce detailed invoices post-checkout, including items, quantities, prices, and custom fields. \n6. Printing Capability: Should allow direct printing of invoices. \n7. Ease of Use: Must be user-friendly for those with minimal tech skills. \n8. Open Source and Cost-Effective: Preferably open-source for customization without ongoing costs.\n\nScenario Example: An order is received by phone.

    "content": "I‚Äôm assisting a friend, a Mexican citizen visiting Canada as a tourist, who bought a 2007 GMC C5500 diesel flatbed truck with automatic transmission and 177,500 km for $15,000 CAD in Hamilton, Ontario. He has the green slip ownership and is aware of the associated freight, taxes, and fees but is unaware of the complexities involved in shipping and importing a commercial vehicle to Mexico. He seeks a company to manage the entire process, ideally delivering the truck to Manzanillo, Colima, a key cargo port near Puerto Vallarta. Returning or selling the vehicle isn't an option; he is determined to ship it but needs guidance. He‚Äôs considering: 1. Finding a local company in Hamilton/Toronto/Niagara to handle everything. 2. Shipping from a Canadian port, like Halifax or Quebec/Montreal, which would require further transport to the Pacific coast. 3. Driving the truck into the U.S. (e.g., New York State) for an American company to pick it up, though he wants to avoid driving it across the U.S. and Mexico. He is looking for recommendations on the best approach or freight companies that specialize in this type of shipment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Start by outlining how you plan to use the 3PL, such as for FBA prep or multi-channel fulfillment. After determining your needs, contact potential 3PLs to discuss your requirements and pricing. \n\nHow to choose a 3PL provider? When selecting a fulfillment partner, consider your supply chain factors, such as product sources, packaging, and daily shipping volume. Look for a partner that can reduce costs and has strong shipping carrier relationships, especially if you plan to fulfill through multiple channels. \n\nIs 3PL right for your business? If you want to outsource distribution and fulfillment, 3PLs can help grow your online business by enabling multi-channel sales and secure inventory storage. It's essential to perform a cost analysis and assess their reliability in fulfilling commitments.",

    "content": "I had nearly three years without fraud issues, which I took pride in. However, I recently let my guard down and faced a situation involving freight theft, though I managed to prevent it before any significant consequences arose. Unfortunately, a reputable carrier became a victim of a fraudulent FreightGuard report on Carrier411, damaging their business. Here's the account with evidence: We had a reefer load from NE to TX, and my operations guy received a call from VOKHID TRANSPORTATION (MC 1226568 DOT 3573700). They provided the driver's name, phone number, truck, and trailer, all necessary for check-in at the shipper. Although something felt off, the driver accepted tracking, and my ops guy confirmed the ETA. The driver checked in at the shipper (drop trailer) but faced delays. The next morning, when he tried to retrieve the trailer, there was confusion over the trailer number, raising suspicions. However, since the truck and driver matched, I decided to monitor the situation closely. An hour later, I noticed the truck heading West instead of South and called the driver. During our conversation, I discovered the driver wasn't affiliated with GOSMART, and the dispatcher had received a rate confirmation from THOR XPRESS 3PL (MC 601820), which was a victim of identity theft. I spoke with someone there to confirm my findings and provided documentation to help them resolve the issue. The driver also received a call from a fraudster impersonating Thor Xpress, claiming the load had changed to deliver to Target in Fontana, CA, with cash payment at delivery. After some questioning, he provided the company name JDS Trans (MC 870454). I contacted JDS Trans, informed them of the situation, and they sent over documentation from the fraudster, enabling us to set them on the right path. We prevented the load theft, but soon after, they received a FreightGuard report from ACE TRUCKLOAD, LLC, attributed to a Jane Watson, claiming they had stolen freight and requested payment. The report included a non-working number and another that led to someone who couldn't confirm Jane Watson's existence. After following up with ACE Truckload, I learned they had the report removed, suspecting their Carrier411 account was hacked. I emailed the address on the report but haven't received a response. Notably, the fraudster had been posting the load on DAT since 10/28, before our load was posted",

I've requested DDP shipping costs from these suppliers, yet since we're receiving multiple cartons from different locations, I believe it would be more cost-effective to consolidate shipments through a single Freight Forwarder in one city. This way, we can reduce shipping costs before sending them to our 3PL, which also charges fees per pallet or carton. I've contacted several Freight Forwarders on Alibaba, in China, and in Australia, but their rates vary significantly. For a consolidated shipment of 200kg, I'm seeing quotes ranging from $1 to $10/kg, with some quotes reaching up to $2000. The $10/kg seems excessive, especially since individual shipments are cheaper. I've been advised to choose Freight Forwarders based where I am located rather than where I'm importing from. Should I opt for Chinese or Australian Freight Forwarders? If I select those from Alibaba, how can I ensure their legitimacy? Would using trade assurance and high reviews provide sufficient security?",

    "content": "Recently, the global push for sustainability has notably influenced various industries, particularly the packaging sector. In Europe, the Returnable Packaging Market has gained momentum as both businesses and consumers favor eco-friendly options. This article discusses the trends, drivers, and challenges in the European Returnable Packaging Market, highlighting innovative advancements toward sustainability. \n\nReturnable packaging, or reusable packaging, utilizes containers, crates, or pallets that can be returned and reused multiple times, contrasting sharply with single-use packaging that exacerbates pollution and resource depletion. This approach helps reduce waste and lowers carbon emissions linked to production and disposal.\n\nThe European Returnable Packaging Market has been steadily growing due to regulatory measures, consumer awareness, and corporate commitment to sustainability. Industry reports predict strong growth in the market as returnable packaging becomes more widely adopted across sectors.\n\nKey growth drivers include:\n\n- **Environmental Awareness:** Increased concern over issues like plastic pollution and climate change has prompted a shift toward returnable packaging as a solution.\n- **Regulatory Initiatives:** European governments have enacted strict regulations to limit single-use plastics, fostering a favorable environment for returnable packaging.\n- **Cost Savings for Businesses:** Although the initial cost of returnable packaging may be higher, long-term savings from reduced waste and shipping costs are encouraging businesses to adopt this approach.\n- **Supply Chain Efficiency:** Returnable packaging improves supply chain efficiency by cutting waste and reducing the need for frequent replenishment of packaging materials, appealing especially to complex supply chains.\n\nHowever, challenges persist in the market:\n\n- **Initial Investment Barriers:** The upfront costs for durable, reusable materials can deter smaller companies with limited capital.\n- **Logistical Complexities:** Implementing a returnable packaging system requires careful logistics for the collection, cleaning, and redistribution of materials, which can be a hurdle for transitioning businesses.\n- **Consumer Education:** Despite growing environmental awareness, some consumers may not fully understand the benefits of returnable packaging, necessitating educational efforts for broader acceptance.\n\nInnovations and trends include:\n\n- **Smart Packaging Solutions:** Technologies like RFID tags and sensors are enhancing tracking and monitoring of packaging assets, improving system efficiency.\n- **Collaborative Efforts:** Companies are increasingly sharing resources, such as pallet pools and container exchanges, to maximize the advantages of returnable packaging.\n- **Material Innovation:** Advances in materials, including biodegradable plastics and innovative composites, are being explored to minimize environmental impact.\n- **Circular Economy Integration:** Emphasizing reusable and recyclable products aligns well with returnable packaging principles, and many companies are",

Retailers worldwide acknowledge this issue and address it with e-commerce multichannel management software. \n\n**Benefits of Multichannel Ecommerce Software:**\n- **Centralized Tasks**: The software consolidates tasks in one platform, allowing for simultaneous product listing across channels and maintaining consistent product descriptions. Any updates are applied universally.\n  \n- **Market Expansion**: By automating repetitive tasks, retailers can enhance customer experience, pursue new customers, and explore market opportunities, enabling them to reach a broader audience both nationally and internationally.\n\n- **Insightful Data Collection**: Without software, data analysis is difficult. E-commerce multichannel software provides insights into customers, orders, and sales, helping create detailed customer profiles that can attract more business and inform profitable strategies.\n\n- **Sales and Support**: This software enhances customer loyalty and sales by streamlining order management and ensuring product availability. Retailers can efficiently respond to customer inquiries across platforms while managing inventory and feedback.\n\n- **Vendor Management**: Retailers can manage products and vendors easily from a dashboard, updating vendor information and prioritizing based on various factors.\n\nWhile multichannel retailing offers great potential, it requires a strategic approach to mitigate challenges.

They process about 5,000 entries daily, increasing during peak times, and ship six days a week year-round. While only a portion of these entries is available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the share of T86 entries is expected to grow as US regulations tighten. The organization is an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base, holding all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They handle a mix of regulated and non-regulated products like food, dietary supplements, and consumer goods, primarily from the US, Canada, or China. Current clearance methods include S321, T86, and both informal and formal entries. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in ecommerce who can manage bulk entry submissions via Excel or API/EDI. The commodities are stable, consisting of well-known brands with long product cycles, not from a marketplace. The goal is to launch ASAP, potentially starting next week with the right partner. They are interested only in brokers experienced with ecommerce T86, and future daily trucking opportunities may arise depending on the partner. This could be a multi-million dollar annual account for a suitable brokerage or forwarder. DM me for more details if you think you can help.",

Our key requirements include: \n\n- Creating a lot code for each harvest. \n- Printing this lot code on shellfish tags, along with the harvest date, location, and customer name.\n- Generating tag information from sales orders and lot selections entered during the sales phase, eliminating the need for repeated entry.\n- Tracking inventory based on our harvests, which we consider as raw material production.\n- Aggregating daily sales orders into a list for washing and packing for shipment.\n- Sorting/filtering these aggregated lists by date, brand, shipping route, and customer to produce various pack-out and shipping lists.\n- Creating purchase orders.\n- Integrating with Quickbooks.\n- Generating Bills of Lading for shipments across the US and Canada.\n- Producing weekly and monthly reports for regulatory authorities based on harvest time/date/temperature, products received from other farms, and shipment fulfillment to ensure safety and traceability in case of issues.\n\nWe appreciate any suggestions or experiences. Our annual revenue exceeds $1 million, with a goal of 20% growth next year. This inventory software challenge is currently a barrier to that growth.

Barcode scanners are vital for quickly capturing product information, ensuring accurate inventory management, and streamlining tasks like receiving and shipping. The scanner's environment influences your choice; rugged models are needed for industrial settings, while lighter ones suit retail. Consider battery life to ensure it lasts an entire shift, and check connectivity options for seamless integration with your network. Performance in speed and accuracy is crucial, as is the device's ergonomics for user comfort during extended use.\n\nOdoo's limited hardware support complicates this selection, often recommending pre-configured Zebra devices. However, not all scanners integrate well, so it's important to choose compatible devices. An effective alternative for Chrome users is third-party software like Cleverence Warehouse 15, which enhances compatibility and functionality. Cleverence supports a wider range of Android barcode scanners, ensuring smooth integration with Odoo Inventory and improving real-time data management.\n\nCleverence also offers advanced features for tracking serial and batch numbers, optimizing storage, and streamlining operations.

Previously, I managed a larger but more organized inventory in warehouse distribution. Now, I work for a small business focused on custom A/V installations. Here are key factors affecting our inventory management: \n\n- We use QuickBooks: Premier Retail Edition solely for inventory tracking.\n- Our main warehouse stores most installation products, which are received there.\n- We have five stocked installer vehicles that carry inventory for jobs. Installers are supposed to notify the owner via email when they use items from their trucks.\n- Customer jobs are billed periodically as portions are completed, meaning goods leaving the warehouse don't immediately update inventory in QuickBooks.\n\nIn summary, we lack inventory management software, and items can be in six locations at once (excluding job sites with unbilled goods). Is the solution just implementing inventory management software? If so, what would you recommend? The company is growing quickly, with plans for more installers, vehicles, and a second warehouse in the next two years. Thank you for any advice!",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to the industry with one year of experience. I work for a 3PL in the US as a broker's assistant. My role involves receiving tenders from clients, building loads in our systems, and posting loads on platforms like DAT to find carriers. I negotiate rates and send rate confirmations, but I don‚Äôt track carriers; that‚Äôs handled by check callers who monitor GPS and handle inquiries. They report any issues to my boss and me. If clients have questions or need assistance while my boss is unavailable, I address those. I also schedule pickups and deliveries via email or various TMS, and I close loads after verifying the PODs. My boss and I essentially perform the same daily tasks, but I don't seek new clients; those are assigned to us by the accounts manager once agreements are made. Can I list \"broker\" on my resume, or is there more I need to learn to qualify as one? Honestly, it feels like my boss and I do the same work, but he has more experience and only teaches me the basics necessary for my duties.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nI'm venturing into inventory management for the first time. A bit of context: I work as a residential HVAC technician and may step into a supervisor position. I have an idea to streamline our warehouse inventory and would like your feedback. Currently, we use ServiceTitan for all our needs (inventory, estimates, sales, client communication) and rely on pen and paper to inform our warehouse manager about additional parts stocked on our vans. He conducts periodic paper inventory checks. I'm considering a program to replace this system with a process involving barcodes, Google Forms, and Excel. The plan is for technicians to scan a QR code that leads to a Google Form with a list of parts, allowing them to photograph the barcode of the part they‚Äôre taking. This data would then populate an Excel file to track additional inventory beyond ServiceTitan. Is this an overly complicated idea, or could it work and has it been done before? I welcome both positive and negative feedback, technical terms, and any extra suggestions. Thank you for your help, and I‚Äôm happy to offer HVAC advice in return.",

Does anyone have insights on the advantages of one over the other? From what I understand, WMS manages inventory from put-away to order fulfillment, while WCS focuses on the product's lifecycle from order waving to completion, excluding inventory management. Cost is also a significant factor, but ROI will stem from reduced labor. I'm uncertain if a WMS, even if cheaper, can achieve the same efficiency as a WCS.",

The company expanded, and for the past three years, I've served as the Freight Ops Manager, focusing solely on shipping operations. Living in a rural area has been fortunate for my job proximity, but the small company offers limited growth. I'm considering remote work options, though most logistics roles seem to involve cold calling or 3PLs.
